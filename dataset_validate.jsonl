First, any child develops thanks to familiarization with modern culture, as if he had mastered the past experience of humanity. This process is based on educational activities aimed at mastering a child with the knowledge and skills necessary for society. Secondly, in the process of development, any child independently exercises his skills due to creative activity. Unlike education, creativity is not already focused on mastering certain knowledge. Didactic games help a child to realize his or her ideas aimed at demonstrating independence, self-awareness, and creating a new one. Therefore, educational and educational tasks in the educational hierarchy are solved in order to acquire some skills, to master it or this rule. Research and creative tasks will be solved to develop a child's critical thinking in the creative hierarchy. Therefore, if the ability to learn generally is developed in the educational process, then the overall ability to look for and find new solutions within the creative activities of the games, unusual methods of achieving the desired result, new approaches will be formed taking into account the proposed situation.</p><p>Speaking of the current state of modern preschool education in our country, it is important to note that educational activities still occupy the main place. In teaching in two main academic subjects - language and arithmetic - children almost always solve educational and educational issues, both meaningful and typical problems. Their goal is to ensure that children's critical thinking develops as a result of their follow-up activities to each subsequent task of the same type. This is due to the formation of skills in solving certain types of arithmetic issues. In this case, the child will not look for a way to solve such problems, because he already knows it, but applies it. If, on the other hand, children developed a further search for solutions in solving each subsequent problem of a particular</p><p>P a g e | <strong>1</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>type, this means that they have badly mastered the knowledge that formed the basis of this type of problem solving method.</p><p>The preponderance of work on mastering knowledge and skills in preschool education, in our opinion, hinders the significant development of children's intellect, primarily critical thinking. Children are trained to solve problems that have a ready-made solution and, as a rule, only one solution. Therefore, children are lost in situations where there is no solution to the problem or, conversely, there are many solutions. In addition, children are trained to solve problems based on the rule that has already been studied, so they work independently to find some kind of new way.</p><p>On the other hand, constantly solving arithmetic problems develops a child's personality, especially his or her attitude toward himself. Gradually, children become accustomed to assessing themselves, their capabilities only by successfully or unsuccessfully solving typical problems, solving them depends on studying the relevant rule, the level of learning certain knowledge. Participating in the game, not just industriousness and diligence, the existence of a game situation, achieving the intended goal allows a child to evaluate himself, indicates its imagination, zukkoli.</p><p>Success in nurturing has a significantly decisive impact on the relationship between children, which is often facilitated by educators. Children can be more respectful of well-educated and well-educated educators than those who think well. This is especially felt when smart kids read without the bleakness and curiosity. This adversely affects the formation of their character.</p><p>However, it cannot be said that there are no functions of the search description in preschool education. Indeed, arithmetic has tasks known as non-standard, and solving them requires children to have intellectual initiative and critical thinking. But, firstly, solving such problems is available only to smart children, and not to all children, and secondly, solving these problems is optional.</p><p>The process of creating scenarios (the content of the game) was carried out in a variety of ways: 1. The scripts were compiled by the trainer in conjunction with the trainer. 2. Scenarios are independently compiled by the children themselves. 3. Scenarios are based on a certain system of fairy tales by a trainer.</p><p>The organization of a didactic game by the trainer is carried out in three main areas: preparation, implementation and analysis of the didactic game.</p><p>Preparations for a didactic game include: game selection: deepening and integrating knowledge, developing emotional abilities, activating mental processes (memory, attention, thinking, speech), and so on; set the match of the game to a certain age group; convenient time; choosing a place to play; number of players; preparation of material; training of educators and children.</p><p>Conducting a didactic game includes: getting acquainted with the content of the game, material (theme); explain the progress and rules of the game; show game movements; determining the role of a trainer in the game; summarize the results of the game; at the end of the game, the trainer asks the kids if they like the game or not, and the next time they can play a new game promises to be fun too. Children eagerly await this day.</p><p>For example, a child is given the opportunity to act at his or her discretion in a didactic game at his or her discretion. Tracking the game noted the following:<br />1. Whether or not a child has an interest in toys;<br />2. The nature of this interest: its level of severity, the selection of interest, the stability of interest; 3. The level of development of cognitive activity;<br />4. Use knowledge in the game;</p><p>P a g e | <strong>2</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>5. Total duration of a child playing with toys.</p><p>Solving this mental task requires not only the active use of enhanced knowledge but also the manifestation of comparison, independent research, and zukkolik.</p><p>Analysis of the game is aimed at identifying ways to prepare and conduct it: what methods are effective in achieving the goal, what has not worked, and why. This will help improve both preparation and process for the game, and then avoid mistakes. In addition, the analysis reveals individual characteristics of children's behavior and character and therefore properly organizes individual activities with them. Self-critical analysis helps colorize the game, enriching it with new material. We tested ten of the strongest winners of national and international tournaments. Analysis of the results resulted in the formation of a psychological portrait of the master of the didactic game, which should have the following qualities:<br />1. Strong emotion and self-control<br />2. The ability to distribute attention to externally interconnected objects<br />3. Sensitivity to Dynamic Situations<br />4. High level of intellectual development<br />5. Abstract Thinking Ability<br />6. Ability to think mathematics (we have arithmetic)<br />7. The Ability to Be Objective<br />8. The ability to notice the distance of objects<br />9. Discipline and will<br />10. Self-confidence<br />This work helped to develop the task of pedagogical experimental work, to develop a serious attitude toward this game, and didactic play was recognized as a way of developing intellectual abilities and self-government.</p><p>During the experiment, statistical methods were used to determine the compatibility between the level of play and the player's results in six directions: general intelligence, ability to read and remember, grades (especially mathematics, labor preparation and drawing), and analysis of didactic games. As it turned out, levels of play are directly props to average results in these six directions.</p><p>Our research has shown that didactic games develop all the characteristics of critical thinking in children who are taught. Didactic games develop the best skills of theoretical, logical and abstract thinking, memory, geometric imagination, creative sensitivity, zukkolik, attention, planning, and making decisions in a difficult situation. Based on the results of the experiment, we can emphasize that whoever plays didactic games better will have a higher academic performance in arithmetic. When we turn to a didactic game, we see that getting acquainted with and studying arithmetic will continue successfully.</p><p>The first important indicator of the effectiveness of the process of preschool education and training is the size and quality of knowledge. Knowledge is the main foundation of human culture, on which any activities of people are carried out.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>3</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br />1.Pf-4947 of February 7, 2017, \"On the Action Strategy for the Further Development of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\" (United States Document, 2017, pp. 6-70).</p><p>2.Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, July 27, 2017, \"On measures to expand the participation of socio-economic sectors and networks in improving the quality of the preparation of publicly educated professionals.\" (United States Document, 2017, pp. 6-70). 3.PF-5847 of October 8, 2019 \"Confirmation of the Concept for the Development of the Higher Education System of the Republic of Uzbekistan by 2030.\" (National Database of Law Documents, 09.10.2019, 06/19/5847/3887-son).</p><p>4.Pf-6108 of November 6, 2020 concerning measures taken by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan to improve the fields of education and science during the new development of Uzbekistan.

This problem requires special attention to the problem of rickets, which has a negative impact on the reactivity of the organism, the course and outcome of somatic diseases, especially in children of the first year of life [2,7,8,10,14,18].</p><p>It is clear that the basis of any complex method of treating rickets is the use of vitamin D preparations. However, the data accumulated in the literature [4,12] indicate that in some children, course treatment with vitamin D preparations is not effective enough.</p><p>These data in the wider world reflect the experience of domestic and world practice, indicating that a number of manifestations of this disease are persistent and insufficiently correctable when treated with vitamin D preparations [13,17].</p><p>The schemes proposed by a number of authors [16,18] using various dosage forms and dosages of vitamin D, as a rule, do not lead to complete recovery by the end of the course of treatment and, at the same time, in some cases it is accompanied by the occurrence of complications - manifestations of hypervitaminosis D [6,9].</p><blockquote><p>P a g e | <strong>40</strong> <a href=\"http://www.americanjournal.org/\">www.americanjournal.org</a></p></blockquote><p>The traditional treatment complex for rickets, along with drugs with a specific effect (group D vitamins), includes pharmacological agents for pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy (group B vitamins, ascorbic acid, calcium gluconate, and others) against the background of the mandatory widespread use of a complex of nonspecific measures that provide optimal conditions for harmonious development child's body. This is a properly organized regime, strict observance of sanitary and hygienic standards for child care, rational nutrition [18-23].</p><p>Specific therapy for rickets, against the background of the described complex of non-specific measures, was carried out with a 0.5% alcohol solution of vitamin D.</p><p>With rickets of the I degree of severity, taking into account the nature of the course of the disease, patients receive 400-600 thousand IU of vitamin D per course. With rickets of the II degree of severity, the course dose of vitamin D increased to 600-800 thousand IU, which the children received in the acute course of 15-20 days, and in the subacute course of 45-60 days. In none of the observed cases, we noted increased sensitivity to vitamin D preparations, side effects and phenomena of D-vitamin intoxication.</p><h2 id=\"purpose-of-the-study\">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h2><p>To study clinical and biochemical parallels in children through a comparative analysis of the clinical features of the course of the disease and the dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism in children with rickets.</p><h2 id=\"material-and-research-methods\">MATERIAL AND RESEARCH METHODS</h2><p>We examined 47 patients who received traditional therapy. Of these, 11 children with rickets, 15 children with rickets aggravated pneumonia and 21 children with rickets aggravated pneumonia and malnutrition.</p><p>Analysis of fatty acids in blood serum was carried out by gas-liquid chromatography.

The dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism (spectrum of high fatty acids) in children with rickets, against the background of traditional therapy.</p></blockquote><p>As can be seen from the table data, in children who received conventional treatment, along with a decrease in the clinical manifestations of the disease, there was a tendency to reduce the violations of some indicators of lipid metabolism, which is retained in sick children, despite the treatment.</p><p>Figure clearly demonstrates that the analyzed parameters changed quite differently, both qualitatively and quantitatively, even within the same link of lipid metabolism. The studies were carried out three times: upon admission to the hospital, on days 5-7 and at discharge from the hospital.</p><p>The stability of lipid dysmetabolism under the influence of the generally accepted complex of treatment is probably due to the fact that the effect of specific therapy in the body is primarily aimed at correcting phosphorus-calcium metabolism.</p><p>It can be assumed that the lack of noticeable positive dynamics of the fatty acid spectrum under the influence of generally accepted complex therapy makes it difficult to implement the action of vitamin D in the body, since it has been proven that under the influence of lipid dysmetabolism, there is a decrease in the level of 1,25-dioxycholecalciferol in plasma, which is one of the most active vitamin D metabolites [1,10].</p><p>This is probably due to a violation of its renal metabolism in terms of lipid dysmetabolism. The redistribution of 24,25-dioxycholecalciferol, which is important in the processes of osteogenesis, also changes in the tissues of the body.</p><h2 id=\"discussion\">DISCUSSION</h2><p>Our clinical observations and biochemical studies have shown that the use of conventional therapy for rickets did not adequately normalize the studied parameters of lipid metabolism, which is probably due to the stability of lipid dysmetabolism in the examined children.</p><p>In all observed children, after a course of conventional complex therapy, the parameters of the fatty acid spectrum of blood serum, the content of inorganic phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase activity, total lipids of blood and feces were studied.</p><p>Case histories of observed children with rickets are given as clinical examples of the therapeutic and biochemical effectiveness of the traditional method of treatment.</p><p>We believed that such a presentation of the materials of our own observations should most effectively and adequately reflect the reliability of general conclusions, conclusions and practical recommendations.</p><p>An illustration of the influence of the conventional therapy of rickets on the dynamics of the symptoms of the disease, the studied indicators of lipid, phosphorus-calcium metabolism in the blood can be the following our observations:</p><p>The child Farhod D., aged 6 months, was under observation in the children's polyclinic N 1 in Samarkand. The boy was born full-term from the 4th pregnancy and childbirth. The mother's pregnancy proceeded with toxicosis of the first half, which was manifested by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite. The mother received no treatment for this. The child's body weight at birth was 3400 g, height 50 cm. He was attached to the breast on the second day, sucked actively. The umbilical cord fell off on the 4th day and the child was discharged home in a satisfactory condition. From the age of 3 months, he was artificially fed. Specific prophylaxis of rickets was not carried out.</p><p>Complaints when examining a child for periodic anxiety for no apparent reason, sleep disturbance, excessive sweating, irritability, capriciousness, decreased appetite.</p><h2 id=\"сonclusions\">СONCLUSIONS</h2><p>In children with rickets after the traditional method of treatment, there was no normalization of some indicators of lipid metabolism. Along with clinical recovery, the content of some indicators of lipid metabolism, total blood and fecal lipids, remained elevated, which requires further correction of biochemical indicators.</p><h2 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><blockquote><p>Ibatova Sh.M.

This problem requires special attention to the problem of rickets, which has a negative impact on the reactivity of the organism, the course and outcome of somatic diseases, especially in children of the first year of life [2,7,8,10,14,18].</p><p>It is clear that the basis of any complex method of treating rickets is the use of vitamin D preparations. However, the data accumulated in the literature [4,12] indicate that in some children, course treatment with vitamin D preparations is not effective enough.</p><p>These data in the wider world reflect the experience of domestic and world practice, indicating that a number of manifestations of this disease are persistent and insufficiently correctable when treated with vitamin D preparations [13,17].</p><p>The schemes proposed by a number of authors [16,18] using various dosage forms and dosages of vitamin D, as a rule, do not lead to complete recovery by the end of the course of treatment and, at the same time, in some cases it is accompanied by the occurrence of complications - manifestations of hypervitaminosis D [6,9].</p><blockquote><p>P a g e | <strong>40</strong> <a href=\"http://www.americanjournal.org/\">www.americanjournal.org</a></p></blockquote><p>The traditional treatment complex for rickets, along with drugs with a specific effect (group D vitamins), includes pharmacological agents for pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy (group B vitamins, ascorbic acid, calcium gluconate, and others) against the background of the mandatory widespread use of a complex of nonspecific measures that provide optimal conditions for harmonious development child's body. This is a properly organized regime, strict observance of sanitary and hygienic standards for child care, rational nutrition [18-23].</p><p>Specific therapy for rickets, against the background of the described complex of non-specific measures, was carried out with a 0.5% alcohol solution of vitamin D.</p><p>With rickets of the I degree of severity, taking into account the nature of the course of the disease, patients receive 400-600 thousand IU of vitamin D per course. With rickets of the II degree of severity, the course dose of vitamin D increased to 600-800 thousand IU, which the children received in the acute course of 15-20 days, and in the subacute course of 45-60 days. In none of the observed cases, we noted increased sensitivity to vitamin D preparations, side effects and phenomena of D-vitamin intoxication.</p><h2 id=\"purpose-of-the-study\">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h2><p>To study clinical and biochemical parallels in children through a comparative analysis of the clinical features of the course of the disease and the dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism in children with rickets.</p><h2 id=\"material-and-research-methods\">MATERIAL AND RESEARCH METHODS</h2><p>We examined 47 patients who received traditional therapy.

The dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism (spectrum of high fatty acids) in children with rickets, against the background of traditional therapy.</p></blockquote><p>As can be seen from the table data, in children who received conventional treatment, along with a decrease in the clinical manifestations of the disease, there was a tendency to reduce the violations of some indicators of lipid metabolism, which is retained in sick children, despite the treatment.</p><p>Figure clearly demonstrates that the analyzed parameters changed quite differently, both qualitatively and quantitatively, even within the same link of lipid metabolism. The studies were carried out three times: upon admission to the hospital, on days 5-7 and at discharge from the hospital.</p><p>The stability of lipid dysmetabolism under the influence of the generally accepted complex of treatment is probably due to the fact that the effect of specific therapy in the body is primarily aimed at correcting phosphorus-calcium metabolism.</p><p>It can be assumed that the lack of noticeable positive dynamics of the fatty acid spectrum under the influence of generally accepted complex therapy makes it difficult to implement the action of vitamin D in the body, since it has been proven that under the influence of lipid dysmetabolism, there is a decrease in the level of 1,25-dioxycholecalciferol in plasma, which is one of the most active vitamin D metabolites [1,10].</p><p>This is probably due to a violation of its renal metabolism in terms of lipid dysmetabolism.

The boy was born full-term from the 4th pregnancy and childbirth. The mother's pregnancy proceeded with toxicosis of the first half, which was manifested by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite. The mother received no treatment for this. The child's body weight at birth was 3400 g, height 50 cm. He was attached to the breast on the second day, sucked actively. The umbilical cord fell off on the 4th day and the child was discharged home in a satisfactory condition. From the age of 3 months, he was artificially fed. Specific prophylaxis of rickets was not carried out.</p><p>Complaints when examining a child for periodic anxiety for no apparent reason, sleep disturbance, excessive sweating, irritability, capriciousness, decreased appetite.</p><h2 id=\"сonclusions\">СONCLUSIONS</h2><p>In children with rickets after the traditional method of treatment, there was no normalization of some indicators of lipid metabolism. Along with clinical recovery, the content of some indicators of lipid metabolism, total blood and fecal lipids, remained elevated, which requires further correction of biochemical indicators.</p>"}]}

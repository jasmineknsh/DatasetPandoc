New discoveries and achievements, exchange of experience and knowledge contribute to the intensive replenishment of the vocabulary of national languages due to the formation of new terms. More than 90 % of new words appearing in modern languages are special vocabulary. The growth in the number of terms in various sciences is outpacing the growth in the number of commonly used words. Moreover, terms are beginning to actively penetrate the common vocabulary, and terminological problems have an impact on the entire language.</p><p>That is why the most important thing for language development is to study the situation in the field of special vocabulary, and further development of communication requires unification and systematization of the terms used. The second half of the 20th century is characterized by a strong development of terminological research, which led to the formation of a new science - terminology. Over time, terminology has grown into an independent discipline that combines such sciences as lexicology, philosophy, translation theory, linguistics and semiotics. Today, terminology is becoming increasingly attractive to researchers, and it is assigned one of the main places among modern</p><p>P a g e | <strong>33</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>scientific disciplines. Terminology is a branch of science that explores the semantic nature, grammatical organization and laws of functioning of terminologies in various areas of human professional activity. Terminology studies the patterns of development and use of special vocabulary, develops recommendations to address the shortcomings of creating, ordering, and using terms and terminologies.</p><p>A term system is a complex hierarchical structure consisting of words and phrases that perform the functions of terms - elements of the term system. At the same time, the integration of these lexical units into rows of the same level and into multi-level paradigms is carried out artificially, using logical methods of analysis and synthesis. Thus, we can say that the term system is a natural-artificial formation, where the material is natural, and the ways of its organization are artificial. The term system is an ordered set of terms with fixed relations between them, reflecting the links between the concepts named by these terms. The term system 117 is characterized by a linguistic and logical system, which allows us to speak of the term system as a language model of a particular area of study.</p><p>The works on streamlining and standardizing terminology began in the early 30s. More than 20 standards for terminology in various scientific and technical fields have been developed and approved. To ensure a unified methodological approach to standardization of terminology, a set of methodological materials has been created that regulate the procedure for developing and writing standards, compiling and maintaining terminological reference books. The methods formulate the following requirements for standardized terms: the term must be unambiguous, concise, systematic, correct from the point of view of linguistics, and derivative. However, state standards are not always used in the real language practice of specialists. This is largely due to the unexplored theoretical problems of terminology, namely, the difficulty of drawing the boundary between a term and a non-term, so the process of studying the relationship between a word and a term occupies one of the important places in terminology. Justifying the opposition of a term and a common word, it is necessary to define the word as a unit of language.</p><p>A word is the smallest semantic unit of a language that is freely reproduced in speech and used to construct statements. The semantic structure of a word is described by a well-known semantic triangle in linguistics, where an object and a concept are distinguished: the word denotes the object and expresses the concept. However, nominativity cannot be recognized as a feature that separates a term from a word, since nominativity is a property of any language sign. Nominativity means the ability of a language unit to independently express the meaning associated with it regardless of combinations with other units, in distraction from its functional syntactic specialization. In most modern definitions of the term, the function of expressing a special professional concept acts as its main differential feature. A concept is an element of thought that reflects the features, properties, and relationships of displayed objects and phenomena of reality, and identifies the objects and the phenomena of the reality as independent objects.</p><p>Common words express general ideas or everyday concepts, whereas terms express professional, scientific or technical concepts. Concepts are the result of generalizing items of a certain class by specific characteristics. The following examples illustrate the meaning and the translation of lexical units as common words and as banking terms:<br />1) accommodation - размещение/housing (a common word), кредит/a credit (a banking term); 2) quotation - цитата/citation (a common word), курс, котировка/a price (a banking term);</p><p>P a g e | <strong>34</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>3) ladder - лестница/stairs (a common word) - многозвеньевая структура/a structure with many units (a banking term);<br />4) maturity - зрелость/adulthood (a common word), срок действия кредита/a loan life (a banking term);<br />5) parking - парковка/a parking lot (a common word) - временные инвестиции/temporary investments (a banking term).</p><p>The most important point in the cognitive study of terms and term systems is defining the central role of a person in the processes of cognition and formation of speech. In light of the cognitive approach to understanding the semantics of words an emphasis should be based on anthropo centrist thinking, language picture of the world language and lexical-semantic variants of the word. It is an indisputable fact that any meaning of the word does not come into the reality in the material form of ready-made knowledge. The meaning is formed only in the mind of the speaker and then the listener. It is a person who acts as an observer and a carrier of certain knowledge and experience, selects language tools for interpreting objects and phenomena of reality, and forms the values of special units.</p><p>The cognitive approach allows us to reveal the causes and mechanisms of dynamic processes in the field of professional nomination, taking into account the changing cognitive and communication needs of people. In addition, this approach helps to form a more complete and comprehensive view of the term, since it takes into account the prototypical categorization and updating of the term in the field of special communication. In cognitive terminology, a term is defined as a verbalized result of professional thinking, a means of orientation in the professional sphere, and an important element of professional communication. The term implements the result of cognition of a special area of knowledge that defines the cognitive essence of the term.</p><p>Moreover, terms perform a communicative function, since they are means of transmitting cognitive knowledge. From a communicative point of view, the term should be compact and convenient for use in professional speech. Due to its concise form, the term is able to convey a fairly large amount of knowledge.</p><p>The study of term systems using cognitive semantic analysis allows us to more deeply examine the processes of their formation and functioning. The specificity of cognitive semantics lies in the fact that the central place in it is occupied by the anthropocentric factor, that is, a person who, in the process of his cognitive activity and due to cognitive abilities. Human cognitive activity (cognition) is aimed at exploring the world around us and developing the ability to navigate in this world using the knowledge gained, which is inevitably associated with classification activities, that is, the need to identify and compare objects and events. The central place in this classification activity is occupied by the processes of conceptualization and categorization, where the process of conceptualization is aimed at identifying the minimum meaningful units of human experience, and the process of categorization is aimed at combining similar units in categories. When describing the processes of conceptualization and categorization, it is necessary to define a concept and a category. Concept is a term that serves to explain the units of our consciousness and the information structure that reflects the knowledge and experience of a person; operational content unit of memory, mental lexicon, conceptual system and language of the brain, the whole picture of the world reflected in the human psyche [4]. Concepts represent the meanings that a person uses in the process of thinking, they reflect the experience, knowledge, the result of human activity and processes of knowledge of the world. The emergence of the concept is associated with the need to identify and distinguish objects of the</p><p>P a g e | <strong>35</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>surrounding world in the process of cognitive activity. The concept brings together all the variety of the objects and phenomena being observed and imagined. In each concept, information about the world that is fundamentally important for a person is brought together, and at the same time, non-essential knowledge is discarded. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with everyday cognition performed by a person in the course of his or her daily activities. For this reason, the concept, which is the central unit of cognitive linguistics, relates mainly to the everyday experience of human interaction with the surrounding reality. Common words reflect everyday knowledge, through which special knowledge itself can be formed. The more structured the special knowledge is, the stronger the connections between terms in the term system are.</p><p>The conceptual system is formed at the expense of initial or primary concepts, from which all other concepts are then developed. Concepts are constantly specified and modified under the influence of</p><p>other concepts. For example, a term “account” is usually translated as “bookkeeper/бухгалтер”. On the other hand, when being a part of word combinations, it shows the specification, since it is enriched with additional characteristics: joint account - общий счет, blocked account - замороженный счет, correspondent account - корреспондентский счет, active account - активный счет, deposit account - депозитный счет, savings account - сберегательный счет.</p><p>Summing everything up it is possible to conclude that the prototypical approach radically changes the previously existing ideas about the ability of a person to categorize the terms. Researching the processes of categorization of terms can be considered as a type of conceptual analysis, since this approach allows to identify various characteristics of concepts that are the basis of the meaning formation, but are not always obvious from the meaning of the word, and reveal themselves only at the functional level, namely in the statement. Языкознание Linguistics 122 At the same time, studying the principles and mechanisms of categorization of the language units makes it possible to identify and analyze their prototypical semantics in terms of their common properties with the prototype of the category. This feature is particularly important for research in cognitive linguistics, since it is the prototypical semantics of language units that largely determine their use in a sentence to convey a particular meaning. The analysis of prototypical semantics also provides a deeper understanding of the structure and content of concepts that underlie the formation of language categories, the principles of organization of these categories, and the mechanisms of interaction between cognitive and language structures in the process of forming the meaning of a statement.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br />1.Lejchik, V.M.

Recognizing the fact that the decline in dental caries coincides with the increase in consumption of fluoridated dentifrice in general, one must realize that the impact of global fluoridation of dentifrice on the population of Eastern Europe and Russia is negligible. In Uzbekistan, the average citizen consumes about 300 ml of toothpaste per year (G. N. Pakhomov, 2006). The average permanent tooth index KPU (indicating the number of carious, filled, and extracted teeth per capita) for 12-year-old children living in Uzbekistan is 2.5. A similar trend is observed in the CIS countries [3], which is about twice as high as in the U.S. and 2.6 times as high as in Germany [4]. The above data indicate that overall fluoridation of toothpaste does not adequately solve the problem of dental caries. One possible reason for the inadequate caries-preventive effect of hygiene products may lie in a formalistic attitude toward oral hygiene and a lack of awareness that oral hygiene is an important factor in preventing not only dental diseases but also exacerbations of so-called seasonal infections and chronic diseases. On the other hand, modern medicine confirms this relationship. Regular and thorough oral care leads to a decrease in the frequency of common diseases, especially colds and allergies [5]. There is a wide variety of oral hygiene products on the market today. Their advantages and disadvantages are widely discussed in the media and professional journals. However, little attention has been paid to their correct use. For example, it is known that the average</p><p>P a g e | <strong>44</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>time for brushing teeth takes at least two to three minutes. However, according to a dating study, most people (about 90%) brush their teeth for only 25-40 seconds [5]. This amount of time does not allow time for the many active ingredients in hygiene products to exert their proper effects. For example, the widely used sodium fluoride begins to \"act\" only 60 seconds after the start of brushing [6]. Plaque and debris remain on the lingual, palatal, and masticatory surfaces of the teeth [5]. This makes it even more difficult for the active substance to penetrate the tooth surfaces, which undoubtedly affects its caries-preventive effect. The purpose of this study was to clinically evaluate the caries-preventive efficacy of three commercial toothpastes formulated with different active substances (fluoride-free mineralized complex, AmF, and NaF) and to determine that the effectiveness of these hygiene products depends on conscientious implementation of preventive measures.</p><p>Patients and Methods As part of the implementation of this study, a secondary school2 in Surkhandariya, where a prevention program has been in place for 10 years and the school administration actively supports and manages its implementation, was selected. all children in grades 1 and 2 aged 7 to 8 years (mean age 7. (4 years old) were given brushing instruction with the consent of their parents or guardians. After the primary dental examinations conducted as part of the planned annual preventive examinations, first- and second-grade children aged 7 to 8 years were divided into three equal groups according to the initial dental status index (index values are shown in the table): group A included 90 children (mean age 7.3 years), group B included 69 children (mean age 7.5 years), group C Group A had 109 subjects (mean age 7.4 years); Group B had the active ingredient \"Mineralin\" without fluoride (R.O.C.S. Kids \"Fruit Horn\"); Group A had the active ingredient AmF, 500ppm F- (R.O.C.S. Kids \"Raspberry Strawberry\"); Group B had the active ingredient NaF, 1000 ppm F- (Colgate Looney Tunes Toothpaste). All these toothpastes are registered and approved for use in the Republic of Uzbekistan. As a control group, 99 7- to 8-year-old elementary school students from another school in Minsk were studied as the \"G\" group. In this group, there was no active intervention in oral hygiene regimen in the form of brushing management All children in the \"G\" group were subject to hygiene programs and dental health lessons The children's (parents') choice of toothpaste, regularity and quality of tooth brushing in the \"G\" group were not controlled, but considering the structure of the toothpaste market in the Republic of Belarus, it is likely that children in the control group mainly used fluoride toothpaste; groups of children in \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" were organized on the day of the school visit, tooth brushing under the supervision of the teacher, mirror, washbasin, and hot water, and was carried out after lunch in a specially equipped room with hot water. The teacher applied 1 ml (or 0.5 cm layer thickness) of the test toothpaste directly to the children's toothbrushes, brushed for 3 minutes, and provided help as needed. Children's participation in the school toothbrushing instruction program was carried out under appropriate hygienic conditions, in agreement with their parents, and within the framework of the \"National Program for the Prevention of Dental Caries and Periodontal Disease in Uzbekistan,\" approved by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan in 1998. The dental status examination was conducted in school dental clinics under standard conditions of lighting, use of instruments, and recording of data. Prior to the start of the program, the oral hygiene index \"OHI-S\" (Green-Vermillion, 1964), the gingival index \"GI\" (Loe-Silness, 1963), and the KPU index, which reflects the intensity of caries in permanent teeth, were measured during dental examinations of the children. The researchers did not know what toothpaste was used by the children in the \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" groups. Retests for this study were conducted 24 months after the program began.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>45</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p><strong>Results and Discussion:</strong><br />Eighty-three elementary school students (out of 90) from Study Group \"A,\" 61 (out of 69) from Study Group \"B,\" 94 (out of 109) from Study Group \"C,\" and 57 (out of 99) from Control Group \"G\" completed the two-year school-based toothbrushing management program. Dropout of program participants was due to relocation, change of school, or prolonged absence from school. In no case did a child or parent refuse to participate in the school tooth cleaning program. School administrators and teachers were highly interested in implementing the Dental Health Program. Examination results showed that the oral hygiene of the 7- to 8-year-old children prior to the start of the program was rated \"unsatisfactory,\" with a mean OHI-S hygiene index ranging from 1.6 to 1.7 units. The mean gingival GI was 0.8, indicating mild gingivitis; 22.5% of the children had permanent dental caries; the mean KPU score for the four groups ranged from 0.41 to 0.51 (p &gt; 0.05). By the end of the 2-year brushing instruction program for clinical groups A, B, and C, oral hygiene scores improved by 40-44% from baseline (OHI-S), so that children in the program moved from \"unsatisfactory\" to \"satisfactory\" in terms of oral hygiene. Concurrent with the improvement in children's oral hygiene levels, an average 30% reduction in the gingival index \"GI\" was observed, which is close to the actual potential for gingivitis prevention in a group oral hygiene program. The difference between the oral hygiene index and gingival status in the studied group of children was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). This paper analyzes the changes in caries intensity of permanent teeth based on the KPU index in children of the study groups \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" compared to the control group \"D.\" In group \"A\", where children in grades 1 and 2 performed oral hygiene using a fluoride-free children's toothpaste, the KPU of permanent teeth (initially 0.41 ± 0.08) increased by 0.52 by the end of the second year of control brushing, with a KPU of 0.93 ± 0.15 (p &lt; 0.05). In group \"B\" with children's toothpaste containing the active ingredient AmF (500 ppm F-), the initial KPU of 0.49 ± 0.10 increased by 0.53 KPU to 1.02 ± 0.15 by the end of the program (p &lt; 0.05). In group \"B\", where the teeth were brushed with a paste containing the active ingredient NaF (1000 ppm F-), the initial KPU of the teeth 0.51 ± 0.09 increased to 0.99 ± 0.12 over the two years of the program (p &lt; 0.05 ).There was no statistically significant difference between the final KPU values of the permanent teeth of groups \"A\", \"B\" and \"C were not (see Table), suggesting that these toothpastes are the same in their effect on the caries strength index of permanent teeth in the lower grades. To examine the medical effects of toothpaste in the prevention of dental caries, we compared the KPU values (increase in KPU over 2 years) in groups \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" with a passive control (\"G\" group) that does not intervene in the daily oral hygiene of school children. The increase in caries intensity of permanent teeth in this group of children was 1.01 KPU: from 0.43 ± 0.12 to 1.44 ± 0.14 over 24 months of observation (p &lt; 0.01).Comparative evaluation of mean KPU values between groups \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" and group \"G\" showed that over the 2-year observation period, the \"A\" group (mineralin) had 49 %, 48% in the \"B\" group (AmF), and 52% in the \"C\" group (NaF), and KPU growth decreased. According to the KPU values at the end of the program, the difference between the \"passive\" control group and the control brushing group was significant (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the final KPU between the \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" groups (see table). It was important to compare the data obtained with the results of a similar program with a larger number of children, which only included first graders aged 6-7 years [7]. The three commercial toothpaste samples containing various active substances showed a similar trend in terms of reducing the increase in the caries intensity of permanent teeth, suggesting that the results obtained were reliable (Fig.) However, in the previous program, the caries-preventive effect of the</p><p>P a g e | <strong>46</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 16 September, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>same dentifrice was somewhat lower (within 30%). This difference is due to the different levels of motivation and discipline of the participants in the ongoing prevention programs. In the first case, the \"dental health program\" was implemented in nine schools, most of whose teachers and administrators were new to such programs, which had a significant impact on discipline and general atmosphere (in most cases, they were skeptical). In the second case, schools implementing preventive programs were selected as schools where such a program had been in place for about 10 years, all teachers were well trained, and the school administration was interested in improving the dental status of students.</p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong><br />Results of a long-term randomized, blinded clinical trial showed that all three commercial toothpaste samples with different active ingredients were highly effective in preventing permanent tooth decay in elementary school children (7-8 years old) who participated in a teacher-supervised toothbrushing program at school. reduction in permanent tooth growth over 2 years in 7-8 year olds, 49% with non-fluoride mineralized toothpaste, which was comparable to the medical effectiveness of toothpastes containing minimal concentrations of amino fluoride (500 ppm F-) or conventional sodium fluoride (1000 ppm F-) in the prevention of dental caries. Since this study showed no significant difference in the efficacy of fluoride-free mineralin-containing dentifrice, americium fluoride-containing dentifrice, and sodium fluoride-containing dentifrice, mineralin-containing dentifrice with the active ingredient \"mineralin\" is comparable to well-known fluoride-containing oral hygiene products as a topical caries It can be recommended as a caries-preventive measure on par with well-known fluoride-containing oral hygiene products. The caries-preventive effect of toothpastes depends not only on the active ingredient in the toothpaste, but also on the regularity and accuracy of brushing.</p><p><strong>Literatures:</strong><br />1.Ахмедов А.

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        currently, there is a tendency to increase the number of patients who do not have teeth at all, which increases
        the level of functional and aesthetic requirements of patients to the quality of orthopedic care [1]. This is
        mainly due to an increase in the share of the elderly population in the general population in almost all
        countries of the world. Previously, removable prostheses were replaced exclusively with acrylic ones, but in the
        second half of the XX century, the interest of scientists dealing with the problem of improving prosthetic
        materials focused on thermoplastics. Thermoplastic polymers and copolymers (thermoplastics) have many advantages
        over traditional powdered and liquid polymer systems used in dental prosthetics [2]. Thermoplastic polymer
        materials have high resistance to twisting, high fatigue resistance (wear resistance), excellent resistance to
        dissolution and stable strength [3]. One of the most attractive qualities of thermoplastics is that they do not
        contain free monomers [4]. In addition, there are practically no voids in thermoplastics, which means that the
        probability of penetration of liquids and biological substances into them is less, which leads to less odor and
        color change, which favorably affects the performance characteristics of dentures. All these factors are
        important in the manufacture of temporary and permanent prostheses during implantation treatment, in complex
        reconstructive procedures and, ultimately, in the manufacture of permanent removable dentures of the oral cavity
        [5]. The main field of application of prostheses without acrylic plastics is partial prosthetics. When treating
        patients with complete secondary prostheses, a number of problems arise. Namely: a change in the elasticity of
        the prosthesis under the influence of intraoral temperatures, especially during chewing load, as well as a
        deterioration in the stability and fixation of the prosthesis in the upper jaw [6]. Therefore, we have set a
        goal to improve the quality of prosthetics with full prostheses and reduce the number of prosthetic
        complications - prosthetic stomatitis. Materials and methods To improve this method, we have proposed the
        following method of manufacturing removable complete prostheses [7]. After removing the functional impressions,

    <p>model is cast in a plaster of the 3rd class with silicone material. The surface of the model is crimped with
        clasp wax and used as a spacer, and the frame is modeled with profile wax taking into account the tension lines
        of the plate prosthesis. The frame is cast from metal (Fig. 1 and 2). The frame is installed on the model, fixed
        to it with adhesive wax, covered with a plate of base wax and the packing of teeth begins. After testing the
        structure in the oral cavity, the basis of the final removable complete prosthesis is modeled, cast according to
        the principles of injection molding (Fig. 3) and fixed in plaster on a special cuvette (Fig. 4). After replacing
        the wax with polypropylene, the prosthesis is machined. Thus, a reinforced full removable prosthesis on a
        polypropylene plate (APPPP) is obtained, which does not have the disadvantages of an acrylic prosthesis and,
        thanks to the frame, does not have the disadvantages of a polypropylene base (Fig. 5). As a clinical trial of
        this prosthesis, 79 patients with a history of toxic-allergic prosthetic stomatitis and complete absence of
        teeth in one jaw underwent repeated prosthetics. Patients in good anatomical and functional condition were
        selected, and the results of the study were objective. The patients were divided into three groups according to
        the method of manufacturing a complete removable prosthesis: Group 1 - acrylic full removable prosthesis made of
        colorless plastic; Group 2 - a complete removable prosthesis with a metal base was made; group 3 - patients were
        restored according to the method developed by us. To assess the effectiveness of the prosthetics technique,
        changes in the pH of the oral fluid, the degree of leukocyte migration, the rate of detachment of the mucosal
        epithelium in the prosthesis area and capillary resistance were studied. This may be due to a certain
        "habituation" to the monomer of the mechanism of homeostatic stability and the formation of a chronic
        inflammatory focus during the first months after the installation of the prosthesis. In the remaining groups, pH
        deviations up to one month were insignificant, and more distant observations indicated a complete recovery. As
        for the degree of migration of leukemic cells in the oral cavity (Table. 2), then this indicator is one of the
        most useful for assessing the quality of prosthetics with removable prostheses, taking into account the effect
        of the prosthetic bed on hard and soft tissues. In the first group of patients (acrylic prostheses), the
        migration index of the adhesive plaster was initially high. However, after a month, its increase was 41.7% of
        the initial value, and the decrease after a year was less than 5.5%. Acrylic prostheses had a significantly more
        favorable effect on the mucous membrane of the subgingival basal cavity than acrylic prostheses. This indicates
        that the prostheses have a potentially harmful effect, stimulating inflammatory processes in the mucous membrane
        of the prosthetic fundus caused by chronic trauma in the first observation period and chronic inflammation after
        6 months and 1 year of use. The results confirmed by the epithelial cell migration test are shown in Table 3.
        Capillary resistance was studied using an electronic vacuum device in the upper and lower jaw before the start
        of prosthetics and after fixation of the prosthesis after 1 week, 1 month and 1 year.. From the data presented
        in the table, it can be seen that the average value of capillary resistance before fixation of the prosthesis
        was 55 s. The index of inflammation of the oral mucosa after 7 days was 31.20 ± 0.76 s in group 1, 26.40 ± 0.50
        s in group 2 and 23.90 ± 0.77 s in group 3. As can be seen, the indicators of group 1 differed significantly,
        which may be due to chronic toxic-allergic and inflammatory processes occurring in the mucous membrane of
        patients with acrylic prostheses After 6 months and 1 year, the numerical indicators of resistance of the
        capillaries of the mucous membrane in group 3 leveled off, although there was a tendency to increase 58.30 ±
        0.39 and 56.40 ± 0.50 with accordingly.</p>

    <p><strong>Results</strong><br />
        Numerical indicators of capillary resistance in the first group for the year showed the smallest downward trend:
        42.30 ± 0.97 ; (40.00± 0.81 s. accordingly, this indicates a deep violation of the vascular bed of the
        prosthetic bed. In the study of the capillary resistance of the second group, the values after a month and a
        year showed a tendency to increase, although they did not return to normal values: 44.30 ± 0.31 ; 53.00±1.35 s.
        The results of this study indicate that the resistance of the capillaries of the mucous membrane with different
        removable prostheses is not the same. However, for all types of prostheses, mechanical trauma by the basis of
        the prosthesis led to a significant violation of the resistance of the vascular bed, which decreased from 51.0
        to 62.1% of the initial indicator. Thus, acrylic prostheses cause a persistent violation of the strength of the
        vascular bed, while prostheses made using our advanced technology demonstrate optimal restoration of capillary
        strength to 52.470 ± 1.01 seconds.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
        The conducted clinical substantiation suggests a possible mechanism of pathogenesis of prosthetic stomatitis.
        Mechanical injury is more or less inherent in all types of prosthetics. However, the adaptation of oral tissues
        and orthodontic correction neutralize the primary injury due to the rigid basis of the prosthesis. However,
        removable dentures are the cause of chronic stomatitis, since they disrupt the submucosal capillary network of
        the prosthesis base and cause local nutritional disorders. Our study showed that the prostheses made according
        to the method developed by us preserve the vascular network of the oral mucosa as much as possible due to
        optimal elasticity and the absence of laminar edges, which reduces the number of cases of traumatic prosthetic
        stomatitis.</p>

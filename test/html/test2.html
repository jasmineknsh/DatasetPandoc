    <p>Despite your emphasis, children's literature is very important for the society of Uzbekistan. It is important in
        educating the young generation to start artistic creation and develop human qualities. Children's literature has
        its own characteristics, it is a collection of works created for Uzbek children and teenagers. These works are
        related to the social and historical environment of the republic, the age of the reader and changing events.</p>
    <p>The examples you used are also important because they show the complexity and uniqueness of children's
        literature. It shows how to train young readers in the process of educating literature. Children's literature
        opens the psyche of the young generation, inspires them to read and creates an opportunity to develop their
        creative abilities [5].</p>
    <p>Children's literature also plays a very important role in the development of Uzbekistan's national literature.
        According to this theme, the art and responsibility of the artistic word should be highlighted in putting behind
        the scary situation in the world of literature and uniting the younger generation. Your work will help make a
        big difference in this direction.</p>
    <p>With all these variables and goals in place, Uzbekistan can help transform its younger generation into citizens
        who develop a stronger and more democratic society. Your experience and your thoughts on this topic are very
        valuable and can help changers to increase the power of the masses even more. The formation of children's
        literature in almost all nations is closely related to enlightenment and reforms of the school education system.
        The stabilization of Uzbek children's literature goes back to the enlightenment movement of the second half of
        the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. About fifty alphabet and reading books created by
        Saidrasul Azizi, Munavvarqori, Abdulla Avloni, Hamza and dozens of other enlighteners for the students of Uzbek
        schools in the "new method" ("usuli jadidiya") are considered bright examples of Uzbek children's literature in
        the literal sense. Viewing children's literature as works specially created for children and determining its
        specific principles is characteristic of the beginning of the 20th century. Uzbek children's literature
        developed under the influence of the leading traditions of world children's literature. Rare examples of world
        children's literature have been translated into Uzbek, world literature such as "Gulliver's Travels" (J. Swift),
        "Robinson Crusoe" (D. Defoe), "Uncle Tom's Cabin" (Bicher Stowe), "Sona" (E. Voynich) rare works became the
        property of Uzbek children. Translation of the best examples of Eastern literature from Arabic and Persian is
        one direction in the translation of children's literature, while Uzbekizing examples of Western literature,
        especially Russian literature, is the second direction. Fables by I. A. Krylov, "The Tale of the Fisherman and
        the Fish" by A. S. Pushkin, K. D. Ushinsky and L.N. A number of Tolstoy's stories, fairy tales and others were
        translated in the same period and included in the alphabet and reading books of the new schools. The creators
        mastered the specific features of realistic children's literature more perfectly through translation. A group of
        writers for children was formed. In the 20s and 30s of the 20th century, Hamid Olimjon, Gafur Ghulam, Ghairati,
        Shakir Sulayman, Ilyas Muslim, Gulam Zafari, Ainiy, Elbek, Zafar Diyar, Sultan Jora, Kudrat Hikmat, Quddus
        Muhammadi, Shukur Sadulla, Hakim Nazir, Polat Momin and the works of other creators were important in the
        development of Uzbek children's literature, in its formation as a special literature. In Uzbek children's
        literature, the genre of literary fairy tales developed in particular. Hamid Olimjon's Aigul and Bakhtiyor,
        "Semurg or Parizod and Bunyod", Mirtemir's "Ajdar", Shukur Sadulla's "Three Bears", "Sly Sparrow", Zafar Diyar's
        "Yangiertak", "Toshkhan with Moshkhan", "Fox's trick", Sultan Jora's Literary fairy tales such as "Zangor Gilam"
        and "Kaldirgoch" belong to the</p>

    <p>ranks of works of art, created on the basis of the traditions of folk art, which are elaborate in terms of form
        and content. In the 1930s, Uzbek children's poetry rose, and its scope expanded [6].</p>
    <p>In the 1940s and 1960s, Uzbek children's literature developed further. The number of children's writers expanded
        to include Nasir Fazilov, Khudoyberdi Tokhtaboyev, Talib Yoldosh, Farhod Musajonov, Latif Mahmudov and other
        writers. Representatives of adult literature, such as Uygun, Mirtemir, Asqad Mukhtar, Syed Ahmad, Shuhrat,
        Mirzakalon Ismaili, Mirkarim Asim, also created works for children. Quddus Mohammadi's "Alphabet of Nature"
        consists of five books, which educates young readers in the spirit of love for mother nature, the world of
        animals and plants. mixed with laughter, the themes are remarkable for their colorfulness and the perfection of
        the image. In the 50s and 60s, Gafur Ghulam's "Shum Bola", Oybek's "Childhood", Abdulla Kahhor's "Stories from
        the Past", Nazir Safarov's "What I've Seen" are worthy of the development of prose children's literature. added
        as a share. Khudoyberdi Tokhtaboyev's works "Magic Cap", "Riding the Yellow Giant", "Death of the Yellow Giant"
        were among the works. These have been translated into many foreign languages. Hakim Nazir's stories "Unstoppable
        Lightning", "Yonar Daryo", "Kichkintoy", "Falcon's Wings" have gained attention due to the fact that they cover
        the current problems of the time and the originality of the artistic image. In the children's literature of the
        80s, Anvar Obidjon, Safar Barnoyev, Rauf Tolipov, The works of Qambar Utayev, Hamza Imonberdiyev and other
        artists were noted for the fact that they serve to educate the young generation in the spirit of the best human
        qualities [7].</p>
    <p>Along with enlightenment and art, children's literature was also important in terms of enlightenment and
        education. This is a very good teaching method that helps to educate the young generation in the spirit of human
        virtues. During the periods described in your comment, the development of children's literature was marked by a
        change in children's creativity due to the enlightenment and education. At the beginning of the 20th century,
        Uzbek children's literature included the ideas of enlightenment, that is, teaching human dignity, attitude to
        human life, and development of enlightenment. During this period, enlighteners of Uzbek literature used artistic
        means to explain the importance of educating and teaching the young generation in different ways.</p>
    <p>In the 1930s, the principles of realistic literature became a priority for children's literature. During this
        period, children's literature began to teach human qualities and educational values through realistic characters
        and events.</p>
    <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, children's literature contained elements of adventure and fantasy literature.</p>
    <p>During this period, heroes encountered adventures, fantastic events and fantastic characters. In the 80s, more
        attention was paid to psychologism, that is, psychological education and the mental state of a person in
        children's literature. During this period, young characters are portrayed as people who are not afraid of their
        studies and experiences, and who have their own views and beliefs. In the 90s, children's literature was
        renewed, and the glory of independence and the revival of national, cultural, literary and religious values
        influenced its history. Uzbek national image and values were depicted in his works [8].</p>
    <p>The priority of topics related to the development of the current literary society (the works of writers such as
        S. Bamoyev, E. Malikov, T. Malik), character traits of children and adolescents, fantastic, adventurous
        expressions (K. Tukhtayev, A. . Obidjon's work), a deep reflection of the complex mental landscapes of children
        and teenagers (N. Fozilov, M. A'zam), works reflecting the spiritual and philosophical problems of the wider
        world, nature and society (M. A'zam, A. Obidjon, T. Adashboyev) will contribute to the analysis of Uzbek

        problems of society, and the spiritual and philosophical importance [9].</p>
    <p>He studied the history and problems of Uzbek children's literature with scientific-theoretical aspects through
        monographs, analysis and researches, pamphlets and literary-critical articles created by them. These analyzes
        are important in explaining the history of creation of Uzbek children's literature, artistic environment,
        creative methods, the role of changes in society and its future development [10]. R. Barakayev's treatise "Uzbek
        children's literature and Abdulla Avloni's work" (2004) also plays an important role in defining the image of
        Uzbek children's literature with a century-old history. Also, among the studies devoted to the work of poets in
        children's literature, B. Ashurov's book "Poetic skills of Tursunboy Adashboyev" (T., 2009) deserves
        recognition. Already, T. Adasfaboyev's poems are researched from the point of view of new principles of
        children's literature, issues of artistic skills that have not been taken into account in children's poetry,
        interpretations of the theme of the Motherland and patriotism, which are important for the education of the
        current young generation, the description of natural landscapes, The peculiarities of creating the image of a
        lyrical hero, their classification as a means of creative study of the traditions of folklore and world
        children's literature, attract attention from the point of view of their popularization. in 20th century, the
        work of many poets and writers, including Q. Hikmat, M. Azam, N. Fozilov, H. Tokhtaboyev, A. Obidjon, who
        defined the image of Uzbek children's literature high artistic works are in great need of analyzes on the basis
        of general literature. From this point of view, a number of collections and monographic pamphlets about
        representatives of children's literature are becoming a unique tool in defining the progressive and genre
        principles of Uzbek children's literature. In short, children's literature It is a powerful weapon of our time
        in educating people of faith and love for the country. The best books of children's writers teach the young
        generation to have the right attitude to life, educate them in the spirit of love for our motherland, work, and
        loyalty to our time. calls to be worthy children of our country [11].</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
        To sum up, the main task of extracurricular reading classes is to arouse the student's desire to read fiction
        books, to teach him to keep a daily life based on the books he has read, and to familiarize him with the life
        and work of famous writers of children's literature in an elementary way. This will help students to become
        fluent in their speech, develop their thinking skills, expand their worldview, increase their creativity and, of
        course, develop speech culture.</p>

However, traditional bakery products often undergo processing techniques that can diminish the bioavailability and functionality of these nutrients. The development of innovative methods to extract and concentrate these bioactive compounds from grains can lead to the production of BAAs that significantly improve the quality of bakery products. By integrating these BAAs into bakery formulations, it is possible to enhance the nutritional value, sensory properties, and shelf life of the final products. Moreover, these methods must be optimized to ensure that the bioactive compounds retain their efficacy during the baking process, which often involves exposure to high temperatures.</p><p>This research focuses on the development of such methods, with a particular emphasis on leveraging regionally available grains. The goal is to create BAAs that not only improve the health benefits of bakery products but also align with sustainability practices by utilizing locally sourced ingredients. Through this approach, the study aims to contribute to the broader field of functional food development, offering insights into how grain-derived BAAs can be effectively used to produce bakery products that cater to both nutritional needs and consumer preferences. This production provides the basis for the use of grains that are harvested as a source of biologically valuable components in the preparation of Functional Foods, which is one of the modern trends in food technology. In this study, a mixture of sprouted grains containing grains of wheat, oats, barley and corn that were floured in equal amounts was used as an unconventional raw material[3].</p><p>This mixture of germinated grains contains vitamins (A, YE, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, n, choline, RR), trace elements (boron, molybdenum, selenium, chromium, iron, vanadium, manganese, zinc, iodine, copper, fluorine), minerals (potassium, calcium, silicon, magnesium, phosphorus), essential amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine) and enzymes (lipase, proteases, phosphatases, α - and β-amylases), have been found to be rich[4]. According to the results of test baking in our preliminary studies, it was recommended to add a mixture of grains, which were ground to a higher grade of flour weight in an amount of 15% to improve the nutritional and biological value of bread. It has been found that adding a mixture of flour-infused grains to wheat flour reduces bread size and its porosity. The use of BAA in the production of bakery products makes it possible to eliminate the negative impact of unconventional raw materials on the quality of dough and bread, as well as activate the technological process, prolong the novelty life of Bakery Products.</p><p>To increase the quality of prolonging the freshness of products made with the addition of a mixture of whole grains, it is recommended to use multicomponent bread enhancers containing minerals (wheat flour, soy flour, starch), oxidants, reducing agents, enzymes, emulsifiers, ground wheat flour, ground wheat extract, improved starches, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate, calcium phosphate, ammonium chloride, carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose), lecithin, soy flour, dry milk, vegetable protein) and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The purpose of the study is to develop a multicomponent cooking improvement tool that increases the quality of the product and prolongs their novelty life, by using a mixture of wheat, oats, corn and barley grain in wheat flour. To improve multicomponent cooking, bfq-quality components belonging to food additives, generally recognized as safe, were used.</p><p>Development of multicomponent baking enhancing additives to preserve the hissium properties of bread made from wheat flour and prolong its freshness with the addition of a flour mixture.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>6</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p><strong>ATERIALS AND METHODS</strong><br />The development of the improving composition of multicomponent baking was carried out using the effect of individual food additives on the quality of bread. The flour from the ground wheat was assessed for its effect on the porosity of the bread, the change in fracture deformation, the formation of the upper layer and the accumulation of chissium and dextrins in the bread.</p><p>The study used a sprouted mixture of wheat, oats, barley and corn grains produced in the Department of” food safety and functional products technology\".</p><p>The dough is made from high-grade wheat flour, the dough samples are prepared according to the recipe, in gram: high-grade wheat flour, 100gr; pressed yeast, 3GR; salt, 1.5 gr; ground flour mixture of wheat, oats, barley and corn grains, 15gr. The dough is kneaded in a two-speed mixer mixing machine (Russia), dressing a uniform mixture with a moisture content of 44.0%. The fermentation period was carried out in a 20-minute tin. Dough processing was carried out manually, the inspection was carried out at a temperature of 40 ± 2 °C and at a relative humidity of 82 ± 2% until it was ready. The bread was baked in an artel oven (Uzbekistan) in a baking chamber moistened at a temperature of 210-220 °C for 28 minutes. All experiments were carried out in at least three copies.</p><p><strong>Results and their discussion</strong><br />BAA is enriched in whey powder, wheat protein powder, tapinambur inulin, carboxymethylcellulose, lactic acid. In bread-making technology, wheat flour, which was floured into the flour mixture, was introduced in 15% quantities, and this mixture was found to be acceptable in 1.8% quantities as an additive that improved multicomponent baking displays.</p><p>The addition of BAA provides the organoleptic properties and specific volume of bread enriched with a mixture of flour, which is no different from control. The introduction of a multicomponent baking enhancer increases the overall, plastic and elastic deformations of breadcrumbs, reducing fracture markers and layer thickness under the crust. The deformation of breadcrumbs enriched with a mixture of ground grain and a developed multicomponent baking enhancer was twice that of control (wheat bread) after 72 hours of storage. The addition of a multicomponent baking enhancer to bread containing a 15% uncooked grain mixture to flour weight increased the accumulation of low molecular weight dextrins by 77.6% compared to control.</p><p><strong>1-Table.

The incorporation of this enhancer into bread-making processes yielded multiple benefits, addressing critical factors such as texture, volume, moisture retention, and the overall sensory attributes of the final product.</p><p>One of the primary findings of this study was the positive impact of the multicomponent baking enhancer on the structural properties of bread. The introduction of a 15% germinated grain mixture into the wheat flour, complemented by the BAA, resulted in a marked increase in the plastic and elastic deformation of breadcrumbs. This improvement is crucial, as it directly correlates with the bread’s ability to maintain its softness and resilience over time, reducing the brittleness often associated with extended storage. Notably, the deformation of breadcrumbs enriched with the BAA was twice that of the control wheat bread after 72 hours of storage, highlighting the enhancer's effectiveness in preserving bread quality.</p><p>The addition of the BAA also had a significant influence on the organoleptic properties of the bread. Despite the inclusion of a complex mixture of ingredients, the bread's specific volume and sensory characteristics remained consistent with that of the control, indicating that the enhancer did not adversely affect the bread's traditional qualities. This finding is particularly important for consumer acceptance, as it ensures that the nutritional enhancements do not come at the expense of the bread’s familiar taste and texture.</p><p>The application of such enhancers in the bakery industry has the potential to meet consumer demands for higher-quality, more nutritious, and longer-lasting bread products, ultimately leading to broader adoption in commercial baking practices<strong>.</strong>The use of a developed multicomponent baking improvement tool has a positive effect on the quality of wheat bread enriched with a mixture of germinated grains and prolongs the freshness of bread to 72 hours without packaging.</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br />1.

The formation of such a style of thinking is associated in pedagogical science with the use of new teaching technologies in the educational process of a university. Note that many of the technologies that are commonly called "innovative" in one format or another have already been used in the domestic education system in previous periods, but for a number of reasons were rejected by it. Decades later, they returned to them again.</p><p><strong>MАTЕRIАLS АND MЕTHОDS</strong><br />Today, the project method is one of the most popular in the world, since it allows for a rational combination of theoretical knowledge and its practical application to solve specific problems of the surrounding reality in the joint activities of learners (schoolchildren, students, listeners). It is worth noting a number of points characteristics of the modern period of development of the project method in the post-Soviet educational space.</p><p>Firstly, there is a rethinking and development of terminology. Currently, in addition to, and sometimes instead of the term "project method", such synonymous terms as \"project technology\", \"project learning\", \"project methodology\" are widely used. At the same time, one cannot but agree with E.S.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>10</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>Polat [2], who believes that there is often a confusion and even substitution of concepts. In recent years, almost any event has come to be called a project.</p><p>Secondly, the project method is gaining more and more supporters. An analysis of scientific literature allows us to state the undoubted popularity of project-based learning ideas, both in school and university environments and, as a result, the unflagging interest of researchers in the problem under consideration over the past decades. The materials of the conducted research show that the project-based methodology has great potential in terms of developing the social and value qualities of the students' personality.</p><p>Thirdly, it is no secret that the project-based methodology was initially conceived for school and tested exclusively within its framework. Its \"testing\" and positive assessment by school teachers contributed significantly to the fact that it was gradually transferred to other levels of education, in particular, to the activities of institutions of the diploma and postgraduate education system.</p><p><strong>RЕSULTS АND DISСUSSIОN</strong><br />The conducted research revealed that the project-based learning technology has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the undoubted advantages of the group technology of project-based learning, experts include: broad and multifaceted interaction of participants during group work on projects, the formation of a group style of thinking and performance at all stages of the project, management of the design process and provision of pedagogical support to its participants, the ability to implement various types of projects and master the forms of their further promotion [3, p. 12].</p><p>E.S. Polat believes that project-based learning develops in students:</p><p>• research skills (the ability to analyze a problem situation, identify problems, select the necessary information from literature, observe practical situations, record and analyze their results, build hypotheses, implement, generalize, draw conclusions);</p><p>• teamwork skills (there is an awareness of the importance of teamwork to achieve a result, the role of cooperation, joint activities);</p><p>• communication skills (the ability not only to express one’s own point of view, but also to listen to and understand another’s, and in case of disagreement, to be able to constructively criticize an alternative approach in order to ultimately find a solution that synthesizes and retains the positive aspects of each proposal) [4]. Despite the prospects of the project method, its implementation has a number of limitations. These include: the lack of teachers capable of implementing the method; the lack of an individualized methodology for project activities for a specific teacher; excessive enthusiasm for the project method to the detriment of other teaching methods; significant time costs; unclear criteria for evaluating the results of work on a project; the inability to evaluate the real contribution of each participant in a group project; low motivation of teachers and students to implement the project method; insufficient research skills among students, especially in their first years at university; uneven mastering of the educational material, especially in comparison with the explanatory-illustrative teaching method [5].</p><p>Today, project-based activities in the learning process are considered by scientists (V.P. Bespalko, G.B. Golub, N.F. Maslova, V.G. Navodnov, N.Yu. Pakhomova, E.S. Polat, S.A. Smirnov, etc.) as the most important method for successfully developing the professional competence of future specialists. Since one of the components of the professional competence of a future specialist is project-based (design) competence, the special significance of project-based learning is obvious. A university</p><p>P a g e | <strong>11</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research</p></blockquote><p>Volume 28 September- 2024</p><blockquote><p>graduate must have knowledge of project-based activities and the ability to implement them at a professional level. Scientists believe that the process of effective development of project-based competencies of future specialists is possible when using project-based learning as a didactic technology and observing a number of pedagogical conditions: integration of psychological, pedagogical, subject and methodological knowledge; creation of a model situation of involvement in the design process (generation of the idea of project-based activities, development of the project concept and its implementation); use of various organizational forms and methods of organizing independent, educational activities of students and their support.</p><p>It should be noted that the theoretical developments of domestic authors are based on local studies of the problem at experimental university sites. In this regard, the experience of teaching design accumulated by foreign universities is of undoubted interest. In a number of foreign universities in Finland, Denmark, Sweden, especially those with a technical profile, project-based learning is structured in such a way that, firstly, it involves mandatory completion of a semester group project, and secondly, an assessment of both the student's group work within the framework of a joint project and an individual contribution to its implementation. When a university relies on project-based learning, it is absolutely obvious that this requires a different organization of the educational process.</p><p>One cannot but agree with the opinion of domestic experts who point out that building an educational process from the standpoint of project-based learning involves substantive and organizational transformations, a revision of the existing system of methodological support. In addition to traditional lectures and seminars, project-based learning should include such organizational forms as creative workshops, laboratories, and design bureaus.</p><p><strong>СОNСLUSIОN</strong></p><p>Thus, the project method developed at the beginning of the 20th century based on the pragmatic pedagogy of J. Dewey is becoming especially relevant in the modern information society. Interest in the use of project-based learning in higher education institutions in the post-Soviet space has noticeably increased at the beginning of the 21st century. The method is being rethought, modified and adjusted to suit the new conditions of functioning of educational institutions and the demands of the time.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p>"}]}

Effective goal setting provides athletes with clear objectives and a sense of purpose. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals are particularly beneficial in maintaining motivation.</p><p><strong>Implementing Psychological Training</strong><br />Role of Coaches and Sports Psychologists. Coaches and sports psychologists play a pivotal role in integrating psychological training into an athlete's regimen. By providing guidance and support, they can tailor strategies to individual needs. Coaches and sports psychologists are central to the successful implementation of psychological training in an athlete's regimen. Their expertise and support are crucial in tailoring mental strategies to the specific needs of each athlete. Coaches provide direct, everyday interaction with athletes, making them instrumental in integrating psychological techniques into training. They help athletes apply mental skills during practice and competitions, reinforcing these strategies through consistent feedback. Coaches understand the unique demands of their sport and the individual characteristics of their athletes. This knowledge allows them to customize psychological approaches, such as visualization or goal-setting, to suit each athlete’s strengths and weaknesses. By observing athletes in various situations, coaches can assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions. They can adjust strategies as needed, ensuring continued progress and addressing any emerging challenges.</p><p>The collaboration between coaches and sports psychologists is vital for effectively integrating psychological training into an athlete’s regimen. By working together, they can provide personalized strategies and support that empower athletes to achieve their full potential. This holistic approach not only improves performance but also enhances the overall well-being of athletes.</p><p>Personalized Training Programs. Each athlete has unique psychological needs. Personalized training programs that consider individual strengths and weaknesses are more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches.</p><p>Monitoring and Evaluation. Regular assessment of psychological training programs ensures they remain effective. Feedback from athletes and performance metrics can guide adjustments to strategies.</p><p><strong>Case Studies</strong><br />Case Study 1: Olympic Swimmer. An Olympic swimmer used visualization and goal-setting techniques to overcome pre-race anxiety. By mentally rehearsing successful races, the athlete improved their confidence and performance.</p><p>Case Study 2: Professional Tennis Player. A professional tennis player benefited from mindfulness training, which enhanced focus during matches and reduced performance anxiety. The player reported improved concentration and decision-making.</p><p><strong>Challenges and Future Directions</strong><br />Overcoming Stigma. There is often a stigma associated with psychological training in sports.</p><p>Educating athletes and coaches about its benefits can promote wider acceptance and integration. Technological Advancements. Emerging technologies, such as virtual reality and biofeedback, offer new opportunities for psychological training. These tools can provide immersive and data-driven experiences for athletes.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>16</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Research and Development. Ongoing research is essential to refine psychological techniques and validate their effectiveness. Collaboration between researchers and practitioners can drive innovation in the field.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />Psychological training is a vital component of athletic preparation, enhancing focus, resilience, and motivation. By integrating psychological techniques into training regimens, athletes can achieve optimal performance. As the field evolves, embracing new technologies and research will further enhance the efficacy of psychological training in sports. Psychological training is an essential element of athletic preparation, playing a critical role in enhancing an athlete's focus, resilience, and motivation.

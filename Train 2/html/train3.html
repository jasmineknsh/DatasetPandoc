    <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br />
        Despite the joy of being pregnant, some mothers experience anxiety and depression after giving birth. Blues
        Depression and anxiety throughout pregnancy and after have a significant negative influence on pregnant women's
        mental health. This research reviewed the available literature. Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Google
        Scholar, and ProQuest, were used for the searches. Journals containing the terms "Spiritual Emotional Freedom
        Technique (SEFT)," "Postpartum Blues," "Pregnant Women," and "Pregnancy" were found in the first search. The
        study's findings indicate that spiritual practices like dhikr and mutual Al-Qur'an, as well as faith-based
        treatment and spiritual beliefs, have the ability to lessen pregnant women's anxiety and despair. This study
        intends to find out if Spiritual EFT could be a useful option for reducing symptoms of postpartum blues, a
        psychological illness that can impact a woman's emotional health after childbirth. The findings of the study
        indicate that using this therapy can significantly improve the mental health of expectant mothers.</p>

    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
        Happiness can be affected by pregnancy, especially for mothers. When a woman finds out that she is pregnant for
        the first time, she often feels both excitement and anxiety (Yagmur &amp; Oltuluoglu, 2021). In France,
        depression affects 11.8% of pregnant women and anxiety affects 13.2% of them. 7.9% of mothers who experienced
        anxiety were primigravida. Anxiety afflicts 373,000,000 pregnant women in Indonesia or 28.7% of all pregnant
        women (Viandika &amp; Septiasari, 2021).</p>
    <p>Depression is one type of mood condition that has an impact on a person's personality. It is also a term for
        emotions such as melancholy, depression, aggravation, dissatisfaction, and suffering. Meanwhile, postpartum
        depression is one disorder that can attack women after giving birth. No one expected to experience this because,
        in general, women who are pregnant, especially those who are pregnant for the first time, are certainly waiting
        for the birth of their child (Zaręba, Banasiewicz, Rozenek, Wójtowicz, &amp; Jakiel, 2020).</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 245</p>
    <p>The Effectiveness Of Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique In Reducing The Incidence Of Postpartum Blues In
        Pregnant Women</p>
    <p>Based on research conducted in East Java, 12.9% of pregnant women experience mild anxiety, 31.4% experience
        severe anxiety, and the rest are classified as normal (Zainiyah &amp; Susanti, 2020). Data shows that pregnant
        women still experience significant levels of anxiety. Anxiety can be affected by age, gender, personality type,
        and physical health. Environmental and socio-cultural variables may play a role (Anggraini &amp; Handayani,
        2021). Age, education level, and family support level are just some of the factors that may contribute to
        pregnancy anxiety (Yu, Qiu, Liu, Cui, &amp; Wu, 2020). In addition, the mother and fetus are also affected by
        this concern. According to (McNestry, Killeen, Crowley, &amp; McAuliffe, 2023), .</p>
    <p>The term "postpartum depression" is also used to refer to patients who experience various emotional disorders
        that develop after childbirth, specifically certain depressive disorders that affect 17.7% of all women
        worldwide and are experienced by 10-15% of women initially. year after childbirth (Hahn-Holbrook,
        Cornwell-Hinrichs, &amp; Anaya, 2018). In Indonesia, between 50 and 70 percent of women experience this
        condition, which has a range of postpartum depression rates between 5 to more than 25 percent (Renata &amp;
        Agus, 2021).</p>
    <p>Previous research found a number of risk factors for postpartum depression, including prenatal depression,
        anxiety, stressful life events, and variables associated with postpartum depression within the first year of
        labor, such as economic disparities (Norhayati, Hazlina, Asrenee, &amp; Emilin, 2015). According to (Wisner,
        Chambers, &amp; Sit, 2006), postpartum depression is a serious public health problem. As a result, mothers may
        experience severe negative impacts, which will make it difficult for them to balance parenting, taking care of
        the house, and fulfilling their work obligations. In addition, postpartum depression in the mother can have a
        serious impact on the child's behavior as well as his physical, emotional, and cognitive growth (Manurung &amp;
        Setyowati, 2021).</p>
    <p>Because many still consider mental problems normal, such as maternal instincts and protective attitudes towards
        newborns, postpartum blues are considered an iceberg event that is difficult to uncover. Pay attention to the
        psychological signs experienced by pregnant women after giving birth. Because psychotherapy has no adverse
        effects on the mother or fetus and does not cause allergic reactions or medication, psychotherapy is essential
        for managing stress and anxiety. Supportive psychotherapy, re-education psychotherapy, reconstructive
        psychotherapy, cognitive psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, behavioral psychotherapy, family
        psychotherapy, psycho-religious therapy, and relaxation techniques are some examples of psychotherapeutic
        techniques. Interventions, etc., will change based on the needs of the person and his or her family (Liu &amp;
        Yang, 2021).</p>
    <p>Energy psychology is a new subfield of psychology that includes SEFT. Using the body's energy system to change
        mental states, emotions, and behavior is the foundation of energy psychology. Various emotional illnesses,
        including sadness, stress, and anxiety, are affected by chemical imbalances in the body. The body's energy
        disorders may strongly influence the appearance of emotional disorders, and changes in the body's energy system
        can alter brain chemistry, which in turn can alter the emotional state. This is supported by a large amount of
        scientific research (Zainuddin, 2014).</p>
    <p>Previous research has shown that nonpharmacological therapy can also help pregnant women feel more comfortable,
        calm, and relaxed while reducing anxiety levels</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 246</p>
    <p>Rahma Zakia Mubarok1, Irma Finuria Mustikawati2, Paramita Septianawati3, Glorio Immanuel4</p>
    <p>(Susilowati, Pramana, &amp; Muis, 2019). Pregnant women may also feel better and relax when touch freedom
        techniques are added. This is in line with previous research (Niko, 2018), which showed that recollection
        therapy can reduce stress levels. The results further showed that the use of Qur'anic murotal therapy helped
        relieve pregnancy-related anxiety, and such anxiety could be managed with the Spiritual Emotional Freedom
        Technique (Wisuda, bin Sansuwito, &amp; Suraya, 2024).</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well spiritual emotional liberation strategies work in preventing
        postpartum blues in pregnant women.</p>
    <p>The aim of this study was to equip pregnant women with a broader knowledge of the Spiritual Emotional Freedom
        Technique (EFT) as a tool that can help them experience the Postpartum Blues less often. This study intends to
        find out if Spiritual EFT could be a useful option for reducing symptoms of postpartum blues, a psychological
        illness that can impact a woman's emotional health after childbirth.</p>
    <p><strong>Results and Discussions</strong><br />
        <strong>Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)</strong><br />
        EFT therapy is a type of psychotherapy that combines psychology, spirituality, and prayer (Putranti, 2021). EFT
        is based on the idea that certain places in the body's twelve energy meridians, sometimes called energy
        channels, have a major impact on certain health disorders. A body that significantly affects our health. Five
        principles to follow when using EFT: assurance, sincerity, surrender, and gratitude. The five things we need to
        do in therapy are Set-up, Tune In, Tapping, and Reflect (Shava, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>The psychological therapy approach that evolved from EFT is called SEFT. Energy psychology is the main theory
        that is the fundamental foundation of SEFT as a technique (Zainuddin, 2014). Theoretically, energy psychology is
        based on acupuncture theory but applies a needleless approach (Gallo, 2017). Energy psychology theory has the
        same assumption as acupuncture theory, namely that everyone has an energy system that controls all physical and
        psychological processes. The energy system consists of 365 meridian pathways of the body that function as a
        space for the flow of chi, chakras, or acupoints that function as centers for energy creation and supply energy
        to the cells of the human body, as well as life force, or commonly done by Chinese healers. Referred to as Chi
        (Gallo, 2017).</p>
    <p>Based on various acupuncture studies, including (Church, De Asis, &amp; Brooks, 2012) found that acupuncture
        points can send signals directly to the amygdala region of the limbic system and other brain regions that
        process fear. According to this theory, (Widodo, Silitonga, &amp; Ali, 2020) found that acupuncture can
        deactivate the blood of the limbic system and neocortex in its investigation. Therefore, compared to
        psychotherapy and relaxation, (Church et al., 2012) found that EFT practices can lower cortisol levels
        significantly. This decrease in cortisol levels is strongly associated with decreased signs and symptoms of
        anxiety, depression, and other psychological illnesses. EFT has a significant impact on fear-related brain
        waves.</p>
    <p><strong>Postpartum Blues</strong><br />
        According to (Olii et al., 2023), postpartum blues are episodes of low mood and moderate depressive symptoms
        that are temporary and limited. In affective domains such as feelings, behaviors, or thoughts, postpartum blues
        syndrome is defined as</p>

    <p>various changes (Manurung &amp; Setyowati, 2021). Etiology Hormonal changes are one of the main causes of
        postpartum mood swings, while their pathogenesis remains largely unclear. After childbirth, estrogen,
        progesterone, and prolactin levels usually decrease dramatically (Olii et al., 2023).</p>
    <p>One of the causes of postpartum blues, according to (Dowlati &amp; Meyer, 2021), is: 1.When hormonal changes
        occur rapidly.</p>
    <p>2.Unexpected discomfort, such as swollen breasts and pain during childbirth.</p>
    <p>3.Concerns that arise after leaving the hospital or maternity clinic and returning home.</p>
    <p>4.Breastfeed.</p>
    <p>5.The way you sleep has changed.</p>
    <p>Clinical signs and symptoms: Sadness, sobbing, fatigue, impatience, anxiety, lack of sleep, lack of focus,
        erratic mood, and changes in appetite are signs of postpartum depression. These symptoms often appear two to
        three days after delivery, peak in the following days, and disappear on their own two weeks after first
        appearing (Olii et al., 2023).</p>
    <p><strong>The Spiritual Connection of Emotional Freedom Techniques to Postpartum Blues Events</strong><br />
        In order to reduce stress hormones, listening to the holy verse of the Qur'an can activate endorphins and
        trigger delta waves. This arrangement can make the listener feel comfortable and relaxed, which will have a
        positive impact on his mind and heart as well as his relaxed, serene, and serene physical state. By lowering
        blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and brainwave activity, listening to the Murottal Quran can reduce
        feelings of fear, anxiety, and stress and improve body biochemistry (Wisuda et al., 2024).</p>
    <p>Dhikr has spiritual and religious components that can increase optimism and self-confidence while boosting
        immunity and inner strength. Dhikr also strengthens one's desire to achieve goals and inspires feelings of
        satisfaction (Fahrizal &amp; Saputri, 2023). It also brings a person closer to God, makes them feel as if they
        are in His care, and cultivates serenity and peace in their soul.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of postpartum blues, according to (Olii et al., 2023), include melancholy, crying, fatigue, impatience,
        anxiety, poor sleep quality, and erratic mood. Mothers will feel relaxed, calm, and serene after receiving
        murottaI AI-Qur'an and dhikr</p>

        <strong>Systematic Review</strong><br />
        A systematic review is a research technique for finding, assessing, and interpreting all research findings
        related to a particular research question, subject, or problematic event (Kitchenham, 2004). Primary research
        includes individual studies, and secondary research includes systematic reviews. A systematic review will be
        helpful in combining

        systematic review, as the name suggests, is a type of research methodology that presents more thorough and
        impartial information by condensing key research findings. Meta-analysis is one method that combines
        quantitative methodology. An additional method of synthesis of results is a qualitative approach. In other

        This research strategy uses qualitative methods. The methods used include meta-analysis and literature review. A
        method called meta-analysis is used to compile research findings from previous studies related to the same
        research question. Using meta-analyses, researchers can evaluate all available data, identify emerging trends
        from the findings of this study, and reach stronger conclusions compared to a single study (Mohan et al., 2022).
    </p>
    <p>In conducting a meta-analysis, there are several analysis processes that must be carried out, including:</p>

    <p>1.Set criteria for research inclusion and disqualification. These scientists set criteria for selecting studies
        for analysis. This criterion takes into account the type of study, year of publication, language, and other
        elements.</p>
    <p>2.These are the inclusion requirements for the study: a.Use English or Indonesian;<br />
        b.Not limited to the year of study.</p>
    <p>c.The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the spiritual, emotional freedom technique in
        reducing the incidence of postpartum blues in pregnant women.</p>
    <p>The exclusion criteria for this study are as follows:<br />
        a.Research is conducted in languages other than Indonesian or English<br />
        b.Research that does not touch on the effectiveness of spiritual emotional freedom techniques in reducing the
        incidence of postpartum blues in pregnant women.</p>
    <p>1.Literature search<br />
        Researchers use specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to guide their literature search. Electronic databases
        such as Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ProQuest can be used for searches. The initial search yielded journals using
        the search terms "Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT)," "Postpartum Blues," "Pregnant," and
        "Pregnancy."<br />
        2.Selection Study<br />
        The researchers conducted a study search using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria after assessing
        the literature. Studies that meet inclusion requirements are added to the analysis.</p>
    <p>3.Data extraction<br />
        Researchers selected related data from each selected study. The data collected may consist of things like
        research findings, research factors, sample size, etc.</p>
    <p>4.Data analysis<br />
        The results of the collected studies are now combined using statistical analysis by the researchers. The
        analysis to be carried out may include heterogeneity tests, publication bias tests, meta-analyses of random
        effects or fixed effects, etc.</p>
    <p>5.Interpretation of results<br />
        Researchers hid the results of the combined study after data analysis. The correlation between the variables
        studied was then further inferred from these findings.</p>
    <p><strong>Systematic Review Analysis</strong><br />
        The table presented showed that pregnant women who underwent SEFT therapy experienced a decrease in anxiety.
        First, research with a quasi-experimental approach conducted by (Shava, 2023) revealed that dhikr and SEFT
        treatment is effective in reducing anxiety in III-trimester pregnant women. With a relatively low p-value, the
        results of Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney's statistical test show a significant difference. This suggests that both
        medications may be useful options for dealing with anxiety in pregnant women.</p>
    <p>In addition, (Zukhruf &amp; Itryah, 2023) research using observation, conversation, and question-and-answer
        techniques shows that many pregnant women do not know about postpartum blues and how to overcome these problems
        after giving birth. However,</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 250</p>
    <p>Rahma Zakia Mubarok1, Irma Finuria Mustikawati2, Paramita Septianawati3, Glorio Immanuel4</p>
    <p>pregnant women understand this issue better after receiving Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) counseling and
        related knowledge. This underscores the need to educate expectant mothers about mental health issues during
        pregnancy and postpartum.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, research by (Jalal, Roya, &amp; Masoumeh, 2023) showed that the SMARTER intervention succeeded in
        reducing depression rates in pregnant women. The results of statistical analysis showed that the intervention
        group and the control group differed significantly. Based on these findings, additional treatment should be
        offered in obstetric services to help pregnant women who are depressed. This is especially true for midwives.
    </p>
    <p>Remembrance psychoeducation, according to (Rofacky &amp; Aini, 2015), can help reduce the incidence of postpartum
        depression. To combat postpartum depression, it is recommended that midwives incorporate remembrance readings
        into their standard treatment.</p>
    <p>In addition, (Liang et al., 2021)) showed that the stress level of type II diabetes patients can be lowered with
        the use of dhikr treatment. The findings of this study suggest that, for some groups, dhikr relaxation may be an
        effective treatment alternative for managing stress.</p>
    <p>According to (Ulya, Rahayu, &amp; Sulistyono, 2023) research with quasi-experimental methodology, Qur'anic
        marital therapy is beneficial in reducing anxiety in third-trimester pregnant women. These findings suggest that
        Qur'anic murottal therapy may be a useful substitute for conventional treatment of pregnancy-related anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>According to (Rizki, Masruroh, &amp; Rahayu, 2023), every pregnant participant in her study knew how to use SEFT
        to reduce anxiety before giving birth and was able to do so. This suggests that pregnant women may perceive SEFT
        as an approach that is easy to understand and use.</p>
    <p>A literature review conducted by (Susilowati et al., 2019) concluded that anxiety in pregnant women can be
        influenced by various variables and treated with various therapies, including relaxation, music therapy, and
        supportive group therapy. The findings of this analysis provide a complete picture of the various strategies
        available to cope with anxiety in pregnant women.</p>
    <p>Overall, the study's findings highlight the importance of focusing on pregnant women's mental health and offering
        a range of therapies that can help address anxiety and depression issues. Because pregnant women undergo
        counseling to help them cope with their worries, the physiological effects of anxiety may go away on their own.
        But this takes much time because everyone's coping style might affect how quickly they adjust. Age may also
        contribute to decreased anxiety in pregnant women receiving SEFT therapy; As they get older, their thought
        processes become more mature.</p>
    <p>As we get older, a person will be wiser in facing challenges, both those inside his own head and those outside
        his environment. Because immature thinking interferes with a person's ability to face or deal with difficulties,
        young individuals are more vulnerable to worry.</p>
    <p>This is supported by research by (Shava, 2023) which found that the purpose of the series of SEFT procedures
        carried out is to ensure the body's energy flow is directed in the right direction through psychological
        neutralization or psychological resistance,</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 251</p>

        Pregnant Women</p>
    <p>which is assisted by prayer for submission. Se-tup performs two tasks. They first surrender themselves to God and
        willingly accept suffering. As a result, the spiritual component of SEFT treatment delivered through prayer
        sentences can improve one's mood. Chest compressions in the afternoon spot area are the second setup stage.</p>
    <p>Adjusting to the discomfort you feel is the next stage of adjustment. Then concentrate on suffering while
        surrendering to God's will. Light tapping at 18 locations of the body is the last tapping technique. Tapping
        will stimulate the active electrical cells because it stimulates the active nuclei of the electrical cells.
        Transduction signals are generated when the interception site is stimulated by biological activity.
        Physiologically, tapping can trigger the release of endorphins from the pituitary gland. By calming and
        eliciting emotions of pleasure, this hormone helps reduce anxiety.</p>
    <p>A person's conception of health will depend on his spiritual beliefs, specifically his adherence to religious
        doctrines. This will have an impact on the belief that everything that happens is the result of the will of God
        Almighty, which must be accepted and thanked in order to reduce feelings of hopelessness and insecurity and
        increase spiritual motivation ((Liu &amp; Yang, 2021); (Rusner, Berg, &amp; Begley, 2016)). Positive energy in
        the form of affirmations from the patient's personal touches will make the patient feel calmer and ready to face
        the situation faced after childbirth (Rofacky &amp; Aini, 2015). This is done by providing therapy to patients
        to provide psychological energy by prioritizing or utilizing what is in the human body itself so that the
        strength in the patient will be more excited.</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
        Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that treatment based on religion and spiritual beliefs,
        including SEFT therapy and various spiritual remedies such as dhikr and Qur'an murottal, can help reduce anxiety
        and depression in pregnant women. Research findings show that the use of this therapy can significantly improve
        the mental health of pregnant women. In addition, a pregnant woman's level of anxiety and anguish may be
        influenced by things like age, personal coping mechanisms, and spiritual beliefs.</p>

    <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br />
        Special attention to health issues is still the main focus of the government in Indonesia. Some health aspects
        that are of concern include health degrees, cross-sectoral cooperation, health development policies, health
        development financing systems, quality of health facilities, health workers, and health supplies (Suparyanto,
        2010). These health problems can affect the general public as well as certain groups such as infants, toddlers,
        pregnant women, the elderly, and workers. The purpose of this study is to run the Tri Darma of higher education
        by implementing community service activities, especially in the form of preparing health cadres to face the New
        Normal Era in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. The implementation method includes a preparatory stage
        that involves coordinating with health cadres, identifying participants, compiling materials, and carrying out
        activities using lectures, demonstrations, and discussion methods. Evaluation is carried out through pretest and
        posttest to measure the increase in cadre knowledge. Findings from the study showed that there was an increase
        in cadre knowledge by 15%. The impact of this research is improving the quality of health cadres, public
        understanding of the New Normal Era, and strengthening cooperation between universities and the community.
        Therefore, increasing the knowledge and skills of cadres, as well as community understanding, is expected to
        have a positive impact on health services and preparation for new situations.</p>

    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
        Special attention to health issues is still the main focus of the government in Indonesia. Some health aspects
        that are of concern include health degrees, cross-sectoral cooperation, health development policies, health
        development financing systems, quality of health facilities, health workers, and health supplies (Afriyanti,
        2020). These health problems can affect the general public as well as certain groups such as infants, toddlers,
        pregnant women, the elderly, and workers.</p>
    <p>In 2020, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak has brought significant negative impacts on various
        aspects of life. This pandemic first appeared in Wuhan, China, and then spread throughout the world, including
        Indonesia. The impact of the coronavirus is not only limited to health problems, but also causes major
        disruptions in economic sectors.</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 206</p>
    <p>Eliyah1, Setya Wijayanta2, Niken Aulia Putri3</p>
    <p>On March 15, 2020, President Joko Widodo gave a press statement at Bogor Palace, West Java, regarding the
        Covid-19 corona outbreak. In his statement, President Joko Widodo introduced the concept of social distancing
        which requires people to maintain social distance, work, study, and worship from home. This recommendation aims
        to minimize the spread of the coronavirus and has resulted in a decrease in social and economic activities of
        the community because the policy restricts activities in public places.</p>
    <p>Some companies have implemented work-from-home policies, while others have opted to lay off employees, even
        conducting mass layoffs. The consequences of the wave of layoffs and the reduction in the number of workers have
        led to a significant decrease in production capacity. The psychological impact of this situation, without
        realizing it, can interfere with the mental well-being of the individual. Two key concepts in the domain of
        environmental health need to be understood uniformly by all health practitioners involved in order for the
        efforts made to succeed optimally. Environment is defined as a collection of physical, social, cultural,
        economic, and political aspects that affect the life of a community.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, community health depends on the integrity of the physical environment, humanitarian principles in
        social interaction, availability of resources essential for survival and disease prevention, the ability to cope
        with health problems in a reasonable way, as well as facilitation in achieving work and education, preservation
        of cultural heritage, and acceptance of gender diversity, accessibility across generations, and feelings of
        control and hope. Health-supportive behaviors include the application of proactive knowledge, attitudes, and
        measures to maintain health and prevent disease risk, protect oneself from health threats, and actively
        participate in Public Health initiatives.</p>
    <p>The mentality approach to the challenges faced has major implications for one's well-being. In the context of the
        COVID-19 pandemic, community service activities present an educational forum where lecturers and students are
        able to present insights while training students' abilities in a greater capacity. This is done by being
        directly involved in actions to help communities in directly affected areas, in efforts to prevent and break the
        chain of the spread of COVID-19 while strengthening food security in local communities to ensure preparedness
        and resilient response to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>Students, along with community members, village officials, and especially health cadres, are directly involved in
        efforts to spread knowledge about COVID-19, make it aware of its dangers, and educate on how to prevent its
        transmission. They also seek to break the chain of spread of COVID-19, promote understanding of interaction
        protocols during the pandemic, and raise public awareness to comply with guidelines and directives from the
        government. Health cadres are also active in strengthening the economic, food, social, educational, and cultural
        security of the community, as well as optimizing human and natural resources available in the village to become
        a resilient community facing the COVID-19 outbreak and remain independent in the midst of a pandemic situation.
        All these actions aim to improve the positive mindset of individuals in the face of the impact caused by the
        Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>Empowering cadres in preparing the community to face the new normal era in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang
        City</p>
    <p>The focus on handling the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted people's attention from the psychosocial aspect, which
        is the individual impact that may be faced due to the pandemic situation. Mental health issues arising as a
        consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to become ongoing problems and can pose a heavy social
        burden. It is stated that the public health emergency status established by global health agencies, followed by
        the enactment of social distancing policies, self-isolation, or quarantine, as well as reduced public mobility,
        can have a long-term impact on people's mental health ((Gao &amp; Sai, 2020); (Amin, Griffiths, &amp; Dsouza,
        2020); (Spoorthy, Pratapa, &amp; Mahant, 2020)).</p>
    <p>Despite volunteering, mobilizers of these health activities often face various challenges, such as degrading
        treatment or negative perceptions from the community. In facing these challenges, a cadre must maintain an
        attitude of professionalism and still provide optimal service, separate from personal emotional feelings.
        Increasing the role of health cadres in improving health services is one of the strategies in supporting
        citizens in maintaining their health, especially those who may experience psychological impacts due to the
        COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The development of superior cultural services in health cadres aims to prepare them to be willing and able to be
        actively involved in developing health programs in their environment. Based on field data, it can be seen that
        the knowledge and skills of cadres in carrying out their duties still do not meet expectations. This is
        reflected in the implementation of posyandu activities that tend to be monotonous and undeveloped, which in turn
        will have an impact on the effectiveness of the standby village program.</p>
    <p>So far, posyandu cadres have played more of a role as implementers of activities than as posyandu managers, which
        should include planning and organizing activities based on their deep understanding of the needs of the
        community in their area. However, in reality, many posyandu cadres are no longer active or their numbers are
        very lacking, and their level of knowledge, attitudes, and skills is far from adequate. In fact, some of them
        have not followed new developments related to posyandu activities, or even do not understand the latest changes
        in conditions and policies related to posyandu management.</p>
    <p>Given this situation, a Cadre Empowerment program is needed in Community Preparation to Face the New Norm Era in
        the Assisted Village of Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. Each RW will be assigned one health cadre,
        and considering that the Jabungan Banyumanik Village in Semarang City has a total of 30 RWs, there will be 30
        health cadres involved in this program.</p>
    <p>From this description, it can be seen that people's attitudes have a significant impact on how they overcome the
        challenges arising from the current pandemic. Therefore, assistance from cadres or health teams is needed to
        provide a better understanding of the current situation. This shows the importance of increasing cadre
        empowerment in preparing the community to face the New Norma era.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to actualize the commitment of Tri Darma of higher education through the
        implementation of community service activities, especially in preparing health cadres to face the New Normal Era
        in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. In addition, this study also aims to contribute from the
        Department of Medical Records &amp;; Health Information Poltekkes Kemenkes Semarang to assisted</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 208</p>
    <p>Eliyah1, Setya Wijayanta2, Niken Aulia Putri3</p>
    <p>villages as partners in the implementation of education. Thus, it is hoped that this research will have a
        positive impact in increasing the capacity of health cadres, educating the public about UPPM programs, and
        strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation between universities and the community.</p>
    <p><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong><br />
        The methods applied in this community service activity, employing participatory and descriptive approaches, aim
        to empower health cadres and facilitate community preparation for the New Normal era in the assisted villages of
        Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. The research relies on data from various sources, including training
        participants, health cadres, and village stakeholders. The study targets all health cadres and communities in
        the selected villages, with the sample consisting of trainees who actively engage in the activity. Techniques
        utilized encompass observation, interviews, and documentation for data collection. Observations offer insights
        into field conditions and the direct implementation process, while interviews directly gather information on
        participants' perceptions and understandings regarding community readiness for the New Normal era. Documentation
        is utilized to record and perpetuate the training process and subsequent activities.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the data analysis method employs descriptive analysis, which involves elaborating and reviewing data
        from observations, interviews, and documentation. Collected data are meticulously organized and analyzed to
        achieve a comprehensive understanding of activity implementation and participants' perceptions related to
        community preparation for the New Normal era.</p>
    <p>Acknowledging potential limitations in obtaining representative data, subjectivity in data interpretation, and
        potential errors in data collection, efforts are made to address these concerns through diverse participant
        inclusion, transparent methodologies, and rigorous validation procedures. Additionally, while recognizing the
        challenge of making generalizations due to contextual specificity, findings are cautiously discussed within the
        studied communities' context to avoid unwarranted extrapolations.</p>
    <p>Lastly, evaluation occurs both pre- and post-material provision to assess the effectiveness of training and
        participants' understanding. Measures are implemented to mitigate potential bias in evaluation, such as ensuring
        anonymity, involving diverse evaluators, and establishing clear evaluation criteria. The results of the
        evaluation serve as the foundation for developing follow-up plans and evaluations aimed at enhancing the quality
        of future activities while maintaining fairness and objectivity.</p>
    <p><strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong><br />
        <strong>Evaluation of Increased Cadre Understanding</strong><br />
        Each cadre has five different roles, namely: 1) Coach, tasked with helping identify obstacles faced, both inside
        and outside the work or life environment, evaluating the positive and negative sides, and finding possible
        solutions; 2) Motivators, seeking to provide support and strengthen psychological interactions between the
        attitudes, needs, perceptions, and needs of individuals, families, and communities before they take action; 3)
        Facilitator, serves as a tool to provide assistance to the subjects under

    <p>study in order for them to receive adequate services; 4) Catalyst, aiming to encourage changes to the problem
        under study in order to achieve the desired result; 5) Planners, tasked with formulating goals, needs, and
        targets to be achieved, as well as planning the implementation of social welfare services effectively and
        efficiently (Setianingrum, Desmawati, &amp; Yusuf, 2017).</p>
    <p>Health cadres' knowledge of the new norm era will be evaluated before they receive training materials, known as
        pre-tests. The aim is to assess the understanding of health cadres about the daily behaviors needed in carrying
        out their duties in the new norm era after the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>The knowledge evaluated includes the role of cadres as motivators, the role of cadres as facilitators, examples
        of the role of cadres as promoters, the new normal era, and examples of behavior in the new normal era.</p>
    <p>The role of cadres as motivators is an effort to provide support and build psychological processes / interactions
        between attitudes, needs, perceptions, and needs that occur in clients, families, and communities while
        performing their duties. Some cadres have understood the role of cadres as motivators, which is reflected in the
        pretest results where 33.3% answered correctly. After receiving material exposure on the role as a motivator,
        the understanding of cadres has increased. The increase in comprehension was reflected in the post-test results,
        where 44.75% answered correctly, showing an increase in comprehension of 11.45%.</p>
    <p>There was a significant increase in understanding of the role of cadres as facilitators, with pretest results of
        16.7% increasing to 50% at the time of posttest. The evaluation showed an increase in cadre understanding by
        33.3%, which will certainly greatly help cadres in increasing assistance to the community. The hope is that
        cadres will be able to apply the knowledge gained in daily life, so as to improve the quality of services
        provided. As facilitators, cadres are expected to provide services that are in accordance with the needs,
        nature, and type of services provided, by paying attention to efficiency and effectiveness in their
        implementation (Laely, 2014).</p>
    <p>The presentation of material on the new normal era after the Covid-19 pandemic was held to increase cadres'
        understanding of their roles and goals as health cadres. In the context of the third question regarding the
        example of the role of cadres as promoters, it can be seen that in the pre-test as much as 72.2% and in the
        post-test it reached 81.25%, an increase of 9.05%. Increasing cadres' understanding of the role as promoters or
        drivers of community activities, especially in the face of changes in current</p>
    <p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 210</p>
    <p>Eliyah1, Setya Wijayanta2, Niken Aulia Putri3</p>
    <p>norms of life after the Covid-19 pandemic, is very important. The hope is that cadres can increase people's
        understanding related to the new lifestyle that prevails today. Examples of behavior in the new normal era have
        been well understood and implemented by cadres, so the evaluation results are very satisfying. In the pretest,
        the result reached 94.4%, while in the post test it increased to 100%, with an increase of 5.6%.</p>
    <p>Evaluation of cadres' knowledge of the new normal era as a whole showed a significant increase of 14.79%. The
        increase started from the pretest by 56.66%, and the post test results reached 72.45%. However, the ability of
        cadres to provide excellent service needs to be honed regularly.</p>
    <p>Health cadres in Jabungan Village generally have been carrying out their duties for many years, so they have
        understood the current conditions. The main impact of the new normal era, apart from health, also involves
        socio-economic aspects. Evaluations related to the new normal era showed an increase of 14.55%, where in the
        pretest it was obtained 66.7%, and in the post test it reached 81.25%. Current conditions demand optimal health
        services, especially considering that some people have experienced trauma and psychosocial disorders due to the
        pandemic. Therefore, it is expected that health services provided by cadres can be optimal, considering that
        poor services can increase the sense of trauma in the community (Fitriana, Kamase, Ramlawati, &amp; Rahman,
        2021).</p>
    <p>In a role it is very different, everyone has attitudes and behaviors that are interrelated or contrary to this
        situation, the roles that occur will interact with each other in a position that does not dominate attitudes and
        behaviors. So every community must socialize and interact with each other in order to establish a situation that
        can build kinship or a respected role by the community to be able to give each other authority in adapting.</p>
    <p>Each individual may have various social statuses that determine the role expected of them in society. A role is a
        set of expectations applied to individuals occupying a particular social position. Humans, as social creatures,
        tend to live in groups. Cadres who have extensive knowledge and the ability to mobilize society are essential.
        One of the main roles of cadres in community empowerment is their ability to encourage community participation
        with social spirit in their environment (Rahim, 2019).</p>
    <p><strong>Evaluation of Community Service Activities</strong><br />
        Evaluation of training programs in community service activities regarding the empowerment of cadres in welcoming
        the new norm era in Jabungan Village, Banyumanik District, is important to do. The purpose of the evaluation is
        to assess the effectiveness of the training process, which includes achieving training objectives by observing
        changes in trainees in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and skills (Suminar, 2022). This assessment aims to
        evaluate the clarity of the material delivered by the resource persons, the benefits of community service
        activities, the relevance of the activities to the needs of cadres, and the ability of resource persons to
        deliver material. This evaluation is carried out through questionnaires prepared by the organizers and filled
        out by cadres involved in the activity.</p>
    <p>Evaluation sheets for community service activities were handed over to participants before the closing ceremony
        of the training. Participants are given the</p>

    <p>opportunity for about 10 minutes to fill out the evaluation sheet by giving a check mark (√) in the column that
        matches their choice. After the filling is completed, the evaluation sheet is collected again by the organizer.
    </p>
    <p>According to (Nagorcka-Smith et al., 2022), evaluating the impact of community-based training programs on health
        outcomes is crucial to ensure that the training continues to be improved and effective in achieving its goals.
        (Johnson, B., 2018) found that longitudinal studies can help assess the effectiveness of community-based
        training programs for health workers. (Brown, C., 2017) emphasized the importance of follow-up plans in ensuring
        the sustainability of community-based training programs. (Jones, D., 2016) compared two approaches to improving
        the effectiveness of community-based training programs and found that a more comprehensive approach was more
        successful.</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
        The implementation of community service activities with a focus on empowering cadres in facing the new era in
        Jabungan Village, Banyumanik District, Semarang City, is part of the implementation of the tri darma of higher
        education. Community Service Activities (Pengabmas) in 2022 were held in the form of training attended by 30
        cadres face-to-face, and succeeded in increasing their knowledge by 15%. This initiative is a contribution from
        the Department of Medical Records &amp;; Health Information Poltekkes Kemenkes Semarang to assisted villages as
        educational partners. To improve the effectiveness and continuity of this program, it is important to
        familiarize the application of the knowledge acquired by cadres with the support of regular monitoring and
        evaluation from relevant parties. In addition, it is necessary to continue to improve the abilities and skills
        of cadres as health program delivery agents in their regions, so that the community can be better prepared and
        able to face changes and challenges in this new era.</p>

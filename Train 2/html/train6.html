<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
SEFT is a psychological support technique that focuses on holistic and spiritual well-being. The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) uses emotions and physical touch, often combined with prayer, to bring about significant emotional and physical transformations (Maryana &amp; Dewi, 2021). Through practices like the Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT), which integrates spirituality through prayer, sincerity, and surrender, alongside psychological energy techniques, individuals can tap into the body's energy system to enhance their mental state, emotions, and behaviour. SEFT simplifies this process through techniques such as set-up, tune-up, and tap (Hidayat et al., 2021).</p>
<p>In the application of SEFT, when negative emotions disappear and positive emotions are transformed, the person is asked the following question: ''What do you think the meaning of all these experiences is?'' This question allows individuals to recognise that adverse experiences can offer fresh insights and perspectives in life (Lina et al., 2019). Negative psychological well-being encompasses enduring stress, depression, anxiety, anger, pessimism, and discontentment with one's present circumstances.</p>
<p>Conversely, positive psychological health encompasses various facets, such as optimism, gratitude, purpose, resilience, positive influence, and happiness. Studies have indicated that positive psychological well-being not only contributes to improved</p>

<p>health but also leads to better social and economic outcomes (Vivolo et al., 2024). Positive psychology focuses on improving psychological well-being and positive outcomes. A key aspect of psychological well-being is the resilience of academic abilities (Li &amp; Hasson, 2020).</p>
<p>Spirituality could play a role in enhancing our understanding of the positive impacts of nature on psychological well-being. According to ecopsychology theory, the formation of a person's 'ecological self' emerges as a result of feeling deeply connected to the natural world, encompassing both its physical and spiritual dimensions (Koburtay &amp; Alzoubi, 2021).</p>
<p>In Covid patients, research has found that there are psychological and social impacts on different population groups. The impact on psychological well-being, namely post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression (De Kock et al., 2021). Patients who have spiritual health always obey the Almighty, and their lives are meaningful and have a purpose, the spiritual element in the intervention will also add a strengthening effect that will create a feeling of sincerity, accept any situation with fortitude, hope for healing, and be able to take lessons (Lopez et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Research also shows a relationship between depression and SEFT. Depression is a condition characterised by alterations in mood, cognition, and behaviour. In 2018, it was reported that approximately 6.2% of the population in the East Kalimantan province experienced depression, with an estimated 1.4 million individuals suffering from mental health issues. SEFT, among other counselling methods, is considered an innovative approach to addressing such challenges (Thalib &amp; Saleh, n.d.).</p>
<p>SEFT can have an effect on reducing anxiety levels. However, it is important to approach using an open mind and considering different individuals. Always consult a qualified therapist for personalised guidance and support.</p>
<p><strong>RESEARCHED METHODS</strong><br />
The research methodology entails conducting a literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Literature Reviews guidelines. Electronic databases such as PubMed and Scopus were utilised to search for articles. The search criteria were adjusted based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, employing specific frameworks and keywords to identify relevant literature. The primary keyword used in this review was "SEFT; psychological well-being" to retrieve evidence-based research articles. The synthesised data focuses on the impact of the Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) on enhancing psychological well-being. The literature review includes articles published between 2019 and 2024 in English. Articles published before 2019, those not in English, review articles, and non-experimental research designs were excluded from the search. The primary aim of the database search was to identify pertinent articles for the review process.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</strong><br />
10 selected articles were reviewed. Article publication from 2019-2024. The majority of research shows that there is an influence of SEFT in building psychological well-being, there is a relationship between variables, namely age, gender, occupation, level of education, and comorbidities.</p>

<p>infection has a negative impact that affects psychological well-being. The research results show that positive and negative relationships have significant results on the influence of psychological health.</p>
<p>The respondents' distribution characteristics were gender, age, education level, and occupation. R DM patients had high self-efficacy after being given SEFT therapy for 10-15 minutes whenever they felt relaxed and calm. The Mann-Whitney test results reveal a significant p-value of 0.003, indicating a notable distinction between the intervention group, which underwent the Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) spiritual therapy, and the control group (Maryana &amp; Dewi, 2021).</p>
<p>SEFT contains tapping and prayer concentration, sincerity, surrender, and feeling gratitude that is repeated regularly with deep and long breaths. SEFT demonstrates effectiveness in decreasing the LF/HF ratio among primiparous women. Additional studies are required to confirm the applicability of SEFT in pregnant women experiencing anxiety(Hidayat et al., 2021).</p>
<p>SEFT is a therapy for pre-menstrual patients by carrying out standard procedures such as The Set-Up, The Tune-In, and Tapping. The findings indicate notable variances in premenstrual syndrome mood fluctuations following SEFT therapy. With a p-value of 0.001 from the analysis, it can be inferred that SEFT has the potential to ameliorate mood swings associated with premenstrual syndrome (Lestari, 2023).</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) therapy has a great influence on psychological well-being. Looking at the p-value results, in general therapy Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) can have quite a good impact on psychology because it reduces feelings that involve spiritual, psychological and physical elements. Several studies say SEFT can also affect patients suffering from diseases such as COVID-19, DM, and Cancer.</p>

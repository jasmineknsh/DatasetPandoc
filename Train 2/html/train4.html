    <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br />
        This study combines data from various studies to provide more in-depth knowledge of the underlying reasons,
        possible risk factors, and protective variables associated with nomophobia in this demographic group.
        “nomophobia” describes a group of actions or symptoms associated with smartphone use. It is considered a
        contemporary phobia caused by society's interaction with mobile information and communication technology,
        especially cell phones. Nomophobia, the fear or worry that arises when someone is separated from their
        smartphone, has become a problem in today's digitally connected culture. This research uses meta-analysis
        research methods. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) were used in
        this study. Studies published between 2013 and 2023 were the focus of the search. Factors that influence
        nomophobia include Duration of Smartphone Use, Dependence on Social Media and the Internet, Compulsive and
        Obsessive Behavior, Social Relationships and Mental Health, Mindfulness, and Demographic Factors such as gender,
        employment status, parental education, and level of education. The results of this search provide in-depth
        information about the characteristics and causes of nomophobia, highlighting the need for focused treatment and
        support networks to address this increasing problem among adolescents. This meta-analysis seeks to close this
        gap by methodically investigating the elements that lead to adolescent nomophobia.</p>

    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
        Virtual communications and new technological devices are valuable resources for the planet. People are now
        finding comfort in computers, tablets, and mobile phones, especially young people, in all aspects of their
        lives. Some of the things these devices help with are internet access, photo editing, listening to music and
        radio, news consumption, address and route search, making appointments, banking, shopping, gaming, and much
        more. At the same time, advances in technology and virtual communications bring both benefits and harm to the
        world. Disadvantages include social hardships such as social isolation and financial/economic problems such as
        huge debts incurred due to the purchase or use of advanced phones. It can also target psychological and physical
        disorders, including electromagnetic field radiation damage, car accidents, and anxiety stemming from the fear
        of losing the ability to use modern</p>

    <p>technology. Nomophobia is a term when using this device causes strong feelings of fear and sadness and creates
        dependence on cell phones (Sharma et al. 2019).</p>
    <p>The abbreviation for "NoMObile PHone PhoBIA" is nomophobia, namely the fear of not being able to use or not being
        able to be approached via a smartphone. This is a fear of the modern age caused by interaction with new
        technology. In recent years, this phenomenon has attracted a lot of attention, especially from teenagers, who
        use mobile devices more often than anyone else. Concerns about the psychological impact, particularly for young
        populations, arise as a result of increasing reliance on mobile phones as instruments for social contact,
        communication, and entertainment (Ghogare et al. 2022).</p>
    <p>Additionally, those who had cell phones for several years and spent a lot of time using them showed higher levels
        of nomophobia. Concerns about over-reliance on technology can be seen in the emergence of social networking as a
        primary form of communication, especially among the younger generation. A possible addition to the DSM-V, the
        diagnostic guide for mental illness, is nomophobia, defined as the fear of being without a cell phone. Given the
        huge impact smartphones have on everyday life and the potential impact on ordinary users who lose their devices,
        it is important to consider the implications of smartphone use on society's general well-being. According to a
        study on parental educational attainment, the average nomophobia score decreased as the father's education level
        increased (Morales Rodríguez et al. 2020).</p>
    <p>In addition, a related study found that the duration of smartphone use, social sentiment, and parental education
        level were all closely related to the emergence of smartphone addiction. (Çiçek et al. 2021) conducted research
        that corroborated the unfavorable correlation found between a father's educational performance and problems with
        forward motivation, loneliness, and smartphone addiction. The conclusions of this study show how risk factors,
        such as the father's education level, influence excessive smartphone use, which is closely related to smartphone
        addiction. Additionally, their fathers' poor educational background and the participants' smartphone addiction
        were linked in other similar studies.</p>
    <p>To address the prevalence of nomophobia among teenagers and reduce the potential negative impact on their mental
        health and general well-being, it is important to understand the underlying elements of this problem. Even
        though this phenomenon has undergone several studies, a thorough analysis is still needed that synthesizes
        previous research findings and finds similarities or different trends between different studies. This
        meta-analysis seeks to close this gap by methodically investigating the elements that lead to adolescent
        nomophobia. This study aims to provide more in-depth knowledge about the underlying reasons, possible risk
        factors, and protective variables associated with nomophobia in this demographic group by combining data from
        various studies.</p>

    <p>Analysis of Factor Causing Nomophobia in Adolescents: A Meta- Analysis Study</p>
    <p>amount of time spent using smartphones each day, academic status, housing type, internet connection, number of
        job applications, and educational attainment. The following are the results of the analysis:<br />
        It is evident from the research findings that undergraduate medical students have nomophobia. It has been proven
        that there is a negative correlation between nomophobia and happiness and self-esteem, as well as a positive
        correlation with feelings of loneliness. Additionally, there is a statistically significant relationship between
        nomophobia and self-esteem. These findings suggest a strong correlation between nomophobia and psychological
        health.</p>
    <p>According to (Gonçalves, Dias, and Correia 2020), there is a good relationship between psychopathological
        symptoms and nomophobia. Three factors have been identified as primary indications of nomophobia: OCD,
        interpersonal sensitivity, and the amount of time spent using smartphones each day. Highly educated people often
        have stronger relationships with family and friends and show fewer symptoms of nomophobia.</p>
    <p>According to (Vagka et al. 2023), 99.9% of participants showed some level of nomophobia, with the dominant level
        being moderate (57.0%). Severe nomophobia was more common in women and unemployed participants (adj PR = 1.57),
        and participants whose fathers did not have a college degree had 30% higher levels of nomophobia overall (p =
        0.029). Additionally, 45.8% of those with any degree of nomophobia said that it adversely affected their
        academic performance, and 59% of those with severe nomophobia checked their phones very frequently (p &lt;
        0.001). Early prevention should be prioritized by creating integrated health promotion initiatives.</p>
    <p>According to (Arpaci, Baloğlu, and Kesici 2019), there is a strong inverse relationship between mindfulness and
        nomophobia in both genders. When they cannot communicate, students with poor attention levels show more anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>Nomophobia intensity was found to have a strong, positive, and substantial relationship with anxiety about social
        appearance, problematic internet use, and dependence on social media, according to (Ayar et al. 2018).</p>
    <p>A clearer relationship between nomophobia and obsession was demonstrated by (Lee et al. 2018). Higher levels of
        obsession correlate with higher levels of nomophobia severity, which may be a factor in the increase in clinical
        symptoms caused by new technological advances.</p>
    <p>According to (Al-Mamun et al. 2023), there is a substantial correlation between Nomophobia and sadness,
        difficulty sleeping, Facebook addiction, and smartphone addiction. In addition, there was a strong moderating
        effect of smartphone addiction on the relationship between nomophobia and Facebook addiction. Reducing the use
        of psychoactive substances and daily smartphone use are two strategies that can help reduce the incidence of
        nomophobia among college students.</p>
    <p>According to (Gezgin et al. 2018), there were significant differences observed in terms of duration of mobile
        internet ownership, duration of daily mobile internet use, and daily smartphone checking time. However, no
        statistically significant correlation was found between the duration of smartphone ownership and monthly GSM
        mobile internet quota. Ultimately, a statistically significant correlation was found between nomophobia and
        loneliness, indicating that adolescents' feelings of loneliness can</p>

    <p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong><br />
        Teenagers are becoming more and more concerned about nomophobia, or the dread of being without a cell phone.
        Research has shown a number of contributing elements. Individuals who are homophobic frequently exhibit traits
        such as excessive usage of smartphones, avoiding locations designated for smartphone use, and constantly
        carrying a phone with them. Teenagers and young adults are more vulnerable to nomophobia because of their
        increased social contact and information availability. Age is a significant risk factor for nomophobia, with
        younger age groups more likely than older ones to have the condition. Furthermore, there are a number of
        established reasons for mobile phone addiction that have been linked to the development of nomophobia, including
        low self-esteem, difficulties sustaining social interactions, and the desire for acceptance from others. It has
        also been determined that the rise in smartphone use and the availability of Internet access are factors in the
        development of nomophobia in young people (Kaviani et al. 2020).</p>
    <p>Nomophobia is characterized by physical symptoms like perspiration and elevated heart rate, as well as
        psychological symptoms like worry, panic attacks, and agitation when the phone is not in one's possession. When
        faced with spotty network connection or limited smartphone usage regions, teens and young adults may become more
        stressed and impulsive, which can exacerbate their symptoms of nomophobia. There have also been reports of
        nomophobia coexisting with comorbid diseases such as behavioral addiction disorders, drug misuse, and
        depression. Furthermore, while nomophobia affects people of all ages equally, research has shown that variables
        like gender and age do not substantially predict the condition. However, compared to older adults, women and
        younger age groups seem to be more likely to acquire nomophobia (Moreno-Guerrero et al. 2020).</p>
    <p>When it comes to nomophobia, young adults appear to be more susceptible than other age groups. The fact that
        young people are more used to contemporary tools and technology than persons in other age groups may help to
        explain this. Gender inequalities may arise from the fact that women use their phones primarily for social
        networking and communication and to maintain relationships with friends and family, while males think that
        mobile phone technology boosts their degree of freedom. People who are nomophobia may never turn off their
        phones or always have them close at hand, even when they go to bed. Some of them may even carry an additional
        phone, battery, or charger just in case they misplace their phone or run out of power. Furthermore, nomophobia
        is sometimes classified as a "situational phobia," similar to agoraphobia or the fear of getting sick and not
        getting help right away; on the other hand, it is sometimes classified as a "behavioral addiction" to mobile
        phones, exhibiting signs of both physical and psychosocial dependence (Karl et al. 2020).</p>
    <p>It has been suggested that social danger is the mechanism via which nomophobia may result in unfavorable
        psychological states or outcomes, most notably tension.</p>
    <p>Research conducted on a sample of university students in Turkey found a strong correlation between using a cell
        phone and feeling lonely. 70 Numerous research have shown that the development of nomophobia as a result of

    <p>mobile phone use is also influenced by maladaptive perfectionism, depression, aggression, impulsivity, and other
        psychological characteristics. It has been established that problematic mobile phone use is strongly predicted
        by low self-esteem. Furthermore, research has looked at extraversion and neuroticism as potential risk factors
        for improper cell phone use. Numerous investigations have endeavored to pinpoint the risk factors linked to
        nomophobia, with a particular focus on psychological and demographic aspects. But nomophobia also negatively
        impacts physical health in a number of ways (Naser et al. 2023).</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
        The conclusion of this research is that the factors that influence nomophobia include: duration of smartphone
        use, dependence on social media and the internet, compulsive and obsessive behavior, social relationships and
        mental health, mindfulness, demographic factors such as gender, employment status, parental education, and
        education level. The fear that teenagers have about not having a cell phone, or nomophobia, is a serious and
        growing problem. Various contributing elements, such as excessive smartphone use, social contact, and
        information availability, have been discovered in the research. Symptoms of Nomophobia can include physical
        discomfort, anxiety, and panic attacks. Because of their reliance on cell phones for social connection and the
        need for acceptance, teenagers and young adults are a particularly vulnerable group. Teenagers are more
        susceptible to nomophobia, which can have a detrimental impact on their mental and physical health. The results
        can be applied in the treatment of adolescent nomophobia. Early prevention techniques and integrated health
        promotion activities are essential to reduce the increasing incidence of nomophobia. The goal of the initiative
        is to strengthen social bonds, encourage responsible smartphone use, and improve psychological health.
        Additionally, it may be beneficial to teach teens about the possible negative impacts of excessive smartphone
        use and provide them with coping mechanisms to deal with the anxiety associated with losing their phone.
        Additionally, educators and medical professionals need to be aware of how nomophobia affects adolescents and be
        ready to offer help and support to affected individuals. The results of this search provide in-depth information
        about the characteristics and causes of nomophobia, highlighting the need for focused treatment and support
        networks to address the increasing problem among adolescents.</p>

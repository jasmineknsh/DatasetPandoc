It is caused by group A nephritogenic type beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteria, which trigger an inflammatory process in the glomerulus. Symptoms of GNAPS include gross hematuria, puffiness, and hypertension, as well as acute renal failure after streptococcal infection. Typical signs of glomerulonephritis in urinalysis, evidence of laboratory streptococcal infection, and low levels of C3 complement are indicative of the condition (Duong & Reidy, 2022).</p><p>In this study, we present a case report of an 8-year-old child who experienced bilateral pleural effusion and was diagnosed with GNAPS. The case report method was chosen to provide in-depth insights into the condition, and the data was sourced from the patient's medical record and supported by a literature review. The patient's medical record included clinical records, laboratory results, and radiological examination results related to cases of GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion in the child.</p><p>In the case presented, the patient experienced swelling throughout their body, reduced urine output, and reddish urine. They also complained of headaches and shortness of breath. The patient's history revealed that they had a fever, cough, and runny nose about a week before the swelling appeared. High blood pressure, positive undulations test, pitting oedema, and bilateral pleural effusion were also observed.</p><p>Treatment for GNAPS typically involves diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and symptomatic therapy. In cases of acute renal failure, peritoneal measures of dialysis or hemodialysis may be considered. The administration of antibiotics in the acute phase does not affect the worsening of the condition of glomerulonephritis but rather reduces the spread of Streptococcal infections that may still exist (Satoskar, Parikh, & Nadasdy, 2020).</p><p>In conclusion, acute post-infectious streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a serious condition that can lead to acute renal failure and other complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for managing the condition effectively (Mosquera-Sulbaran, Pedreañez, Vargas, & Hernandez-Fonseca, 2023). This case report provides valuable insights into the presentation, diagnosis, and management of GNAPS in the pediatric population.</p><p><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong><br />This study adopted the case report method conducted on an 8-year-old child with a diagnosis of acute post-infectious streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GNAPS) and experienced bilateral pleural effusion. The case report method was chosen to focus on in-depth investigations into specific cases that can provide valuable insights into understanding the condition. The object of this study was an 8-year-old child with GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion.</p><p>The source of this study data involved the patient's medical record, including clinical records, laboratory results, and radiological examination results related to cases of GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion in the child. In addition, to support the analysis, a literature review was also conducted using the PubMed database to gain broader insight into GNAPS in the pediatric population.</p><p>The population that was the focus of this study was children with GNAPS, while the sample studied was a specific case of an 8-year-old child with GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion. Research techniques and tools include collecting medical data from patient medical records, including physical examination, laboratory results, and radiological results. Data analysis techniques involve in-depth evaluation of the patient's clinical and laboratory data, as well as benchmarking with findings from literature reviews that have been conducted to present comprehensive information about the case.</p><p>Thus, this study not only describes a specific case of GNAPS with bilateral pleural effusion in an 8-year-old child but also provides a supportive literature review to enrich the understanding of the case in the context of the pediatric population.</p><p><strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong><br />In this study, it was found that patients experienced swelling throughout their bodies, namely the face, both hands and feet, including the testicles. In addition, the patient's urine is also reduced (oliguria) and becomes reddish (hematuria). Patients also complain of headaches and shortness of breath. From previous history, it is known that patients experience fever, cough, and runny nose about a week before swelling appears. In addition, high blood pressure of 150/110 mmHG (hypertension), positive undulations test, pitting oedema in the periorbita, both legs and scrotum. As well as obtained x-ray results of bilateral pleural effusion thorax, laboratory results of BUN (91) and ASTO (159.26) increased, but GFR (75) and C3c (43.3) decreased, and urinalysis results obtained erythrocytes +2 on the dipstick and 1-3 / LP in sediment. Treatment consists of diuretics and calcium channel blockers, followed by symptomatic therapy and diet management.</p><p><strong>Case Report</strong><br /><strong>Identity</strong><br />a.An. ASP, 8 years old, Male, Lamongan<br />b.Mr. S, 48 years old, Private<br />c.Mrs. S, 46 years old, Housewife<br /><strong>Anamnesis</strong><br />Main Complaint: Swelling all over the body for one week before being taken to the hospital. The patient is a referral from a type C hospital in one of the districts in East Java Province. The patient had swelling all over the body for one week before being taken to the hospital. Initially, the patient only experienced swelling of the eyes, especially in the morning, and slightly deflated during the day. By the time he arrived at the emergency department, there was swelling all over the face, both hands and feet and the patient's testicles. Patients also complain of shortness of breath at the beginning of the appearance of swelling, which is felt increasingly aggravated so that the patient is more comfortable in a half-sitting position. About a week before the swelling occurred, the patient developed a fever accompanied by a cough and runny nose but recovered after 5 days of taking antibiotics. When there begins to be swelling, the patient's urine becomes slight and reddish. In addition, patients also often complain of headaches. A previous history of shortness of breath was denied. A history of shortness of breath during activity is also denied. There is no history of morning sneezing and yellow eyes. There are no complaints of difficult farting or defecation. Patients have received prednisone tablets at a dose of 2 mg (5-5-4), NSAID type mefenamic acid 3x1 tablets, furosemide half tablets 24 hours, and captopril 3x12.5 mg, but there has been no improvement after treatment for 7 days. The patient was born normally, full-term, assisted by a midwife with a birth weight of 3800 grams, crying immediately, not blue and not yellow. At the time of pregnancy, the patient's mother routinely controls the village midwife and does not experience any complaints. Patients have the same history of growth and development as their peers. Patients can prop their heads at 3 months of age, lie on their stomachs at 6 months of age, sit at 9 months of age, stand at 12 months of age and walk at 16 months of age. Patients can play stacking cubes or play ball at 23 months of age. Patients can talk at the age of 2 years, and until now patients are known to communicate well in the environment around home and school. In infancy, patients do not get breast milk intake, so patients get nutrition from formula milk alone from the age of 0 months to 2 years with sufficient frequency and amount. Patients begin to get MP-ASI at the age of 6 months with a balanced type and amount. Patients from the age of 1 year begin to eat a balanced adult diet and have no history of allergy to chicken, eggs, or fish. </p><p>The patient has no history of allergies to food, dust, smoke, or drugs. The patient also had no history of congenital heart disease. From birth to the present, the patient has never been hospitalized, nor has he had a history of previous surgery. The patient's previous immunization history can also be said to be complete, namely BCG and measles immunization once and DPT, Hepatitis B, and polio immunization 3 times. In the patient's family, no one has the same history of illness as the patient is currently experiencing. However, the patient's grandmother had a history of heart disease.</p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 228</p><p>Yuan Agita Aprilia R1*, Adivia Cheries D2</p><p>The patient is currently in elementary school.

The incidenceof GNAPS is also influenced by climate, nutrition, general state, and history of allergies ((Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani, Aziz, &amp; Amanullah, 2022)).</p><p>Although streptococcal bacteria do not damage the kidneys directly, GNAPS produce antigen-antibody complexes that circulate to the glomerulus, where they are mechanically trapped in the basement membrane ((Mosquera &amp;Pedreañez, 2021); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022)). Complement will fixate, causing injury and inflammation, then polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelets will be attracted to the injured area. The endothelium and glomerular basement membrane (IGBM) are also damaged by phagocytosis and the release of lysosomal enzymes, and the proliferation of endothelial, mesangium, and epithelial cells appear in response to damage.</p><p>Increased leakage of glomerulus capillaries allows proteins and erythrocytes to enter the urine, causing proteinuria and hematuria. On microscopic examination, the glomerulus appears swollen and hypercellular with PMN invasion, and antigen-antibody complement complexes appear as subepithelial nodules as granular and lumpy ((Ge et al., 2020); (Glomerulopathy, Glomerulopathy, &amp; Glomerulopathy, 2023); (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)).GNAPS occurs due to type III hypersensitivity reactions. In this reaction, the immune complex attacks the streptococcal nephritogenic antigens that settle in the basement membrane of the glomerulus and involve activation of complement.</p><p>Complement activation mainly occurs through alternative pathways, but activation of the classical pathway also occurs due to the binding of immunoglobulin proteins on the surface of streptococci. ((Syed, Viazmina, Mager,Meri, &amp; Haapasalo, 2020); (Zhang et al., 2023)). Blood pressure in glomerular capillaries is almost four times higher than in other capillaries, causing deposits in the immune complex. Deposits are also more abundant in branching areas, where blood flow turbulence occurs ((Sethi, De Vriese, &amp; Fervenza, 2022); (Köppl &amp; Helmig, n.d.)).</p><p>The nature of antigens in the immune complex and antigens against their antibodies is associated with the nature of certain tissues. Cationic antigens will attach to anionic areas of the basal membrane, usually in the subepithelial. IgM and IgG immune complexes more often settle in the glomerulus as they flow through the glomerulus, larger immune complexes will collect between the endothelium and the basement membrane, and smaller immune complexes will penetrate the basement membrane and attach to epithelial cells ((Matsumoto et al., 2022)). The cell-mediated mechanism also plays a role in the formation of GNAPS. Glomerular infiltration by lymphocyte cells and macrophages has long been known to play a role in the cause of GNAPS. Lymphocyte intercellular spring molecules such as ICAM-I and LFA are found in the glomerulus and tubulointerstitial and are associated with infiltration and inflammation rates ((Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)).</p><p>GNAPS has varying clinical characteristics. Children usually show mild symptoms, but it is not uncommon for them to show severe symptoms. As mentioned earlier, damage to the walls of glomerulus capillaries leads to flesh-red albuminuria and hematuria. Urine may be</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 231</p><blockquote><p>An 8-Years-Old Child With Post Streptococcal Related Acute Glomerulonephritis Accompanied By Pleural Effusion: Case Report</p><p>reddish or coffee-coloured and is sometimes accompanied by mild oedema around the eyes or up to the entire body. Oliguria and heart failure usually cause severe oedema. A decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the cause of oedema, which causes reduced excretion of water, sodium, and nitrogen, causing oedema and azotemia. Increased aldosterone can also affect water and sodium retention ((Colvin, Chang, &amp; Cornell, 2023); (Bertschi, 2020); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022)). An increase in the hormone aldosterone can affect sodium and water retention. Although oedema is most common in the lower limbs by noon, oedema of the face, especially the periorbita, often occurs in the morning ((Lombel, Brakeman, Sack, &amp; Butani, 2022)). On the first day of GNA, 60-70% of children develop hypertension, but by the end of the first week, it returns to normal ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)). Blood pressure will remain high for several weeks and become permanent if kidney tissue damage persists. On the first day, the body temperature may be rather high. When there are no other symptoms of infection before, sometimes heat symptoms are still present. People with GNA often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, no appetite, constipation, and diarrhoea ((Rajindrajith, Devanarayana, Chanpong, &amp; Thapar, 2020); (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)).</p><p>Urinalysis showed that almost 50% of patients had macroscopic hematuria, proteinuria (+1 to +4), urinary sediment abnormalities with dysphoric erythrocytes and leukocyturia, as well as luletal thoracic, granular, erythrocytes (++), albumin (+), and leukocyte cylinders (++), among others. Signs of kidney failure such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia sometimes make serum ureal and creatinine levels rise. Sometimes, the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome are accompanied by high proteinuria. During the first week, almost all patients showed low levels of total serum hemolytic complement (total complement hemolytic) and C3; however, the average C4 is low or drops only slightly, and in 50% of patients, properdin levels fall.</p><p>In this situation, an alternate path of the compound is enabled. In patients with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, the decrease in C3 is very pronounced, with levels between 20 and 40 mg/dl (normal values are 50 to 140 mg/dl). Increased C3 is not associated with disease severity or cure. Within six to eight weeks, complement levels will return to normal levels, but only for diagnosis of GNAPS ((Newcomer et al., 2021); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani et al., 2022); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)). In addition to antistreptozyme, ASTO, anti-hyaluronidase, and anti-Dnase B, several serological tests of streptococcal antigens can be used to determine the presence of infection.</p><p>Antistreptolysin screening is helpful because it can measure antibodies against various streptococcal antigens. Although some streptococcal strains do not produce streptolysin O, serum should be tested against more than one streptococcal antigen. However, anti-streptolysin O titers may be elevated in 75–80% of patients with GNAPS with pharyngitis. More than 90 per cent of cases show streptococcal infection after performing all serological tests. Although ASTO titers increase in only 50% of cases, antibodies to streptococcal antigens are usually positive due to anti-hyaluronidase or other antibodies. The titer test should be done serially because, at the beginning of the disease, the titer of streptococcal antibodies has not increased. If the titer increases two to three times, it indicates that there is an infection. Histopathological examination shows that diffuse glomerulonephritis occurs because almost all glomerulus are affected.</p><p>On macroscopic examination, the kidneys look slightly enlarged and pale, and there are bleeding points in the cortex as a result of the proliferation of strong glomerular endothelial cells, capillary lumen, and Bowman's closed hoop space. In addition, there is also</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 232</p><blockquote><p>Yuan Agita Aprilia R1*, Adivia Cheries D2</p><p>infiltration of monocyte cells, polymorphonuclear, and capsule epithelial cells so that the thickened basement membrane will look irregular when examined through an electron microscope. Streptococcal globulins, complements, and antigens can form hump clumps in the subepithelium (Khalighi &amp; Chang, 2021).</p><p>Patients who exhibit symptoms such as gross hematuria, puffiness, and hypertension, as well as acute renal failure after streptococcal infection, should suspect post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis. Typical signs of glomerulonephritis in urinalysis, evidence of laboratory streptococcal infection (ASTO more than 100 Todd), and low levels of C3 complement (less than 4 years or more than 15 years) have a history of disease with similar symptoms, accompanied by chronic renal failure, GFR below 50% of normal age, macroscopic hematuria more than 3 months or microscopic hematuria more than 1 year, C3 levels decrease over 3 months as well as refractory proteinuria.</p><p>Management of GNAPS patients is symptomatic and more aimed at preventing acute renal failure and eradication of the organism ((Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); Smith J.M., 2003; (Sikesa &amp; Loekman, 2020); (Ramdhani, Harun, &amp; Marlina, 2022)). Immediate medical care is required if symptoms of oedema, hypertension, or elevated blood creatinine are present. The patient does not experience a negative impact on the course of the disease after resting for three to four weeks, and can then begin mobilization after three to four weeks from the onset of the disease (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023). Giving antibiotics in the acute phase does not affect the worsening of the condition of glomerulonephritis, but rather reduces the spread of Streptococcal infections that may still exist. In the acute phase, penicillin administration is recommended only for ten days.</p><p>However, after the state of nephritis improves (the causative germ decreases and disappears), the administration of penicillin for prevention or prophylaxis for a long period is not recommended due to the presence of persistent immune mechanisms. Although there is a small chance that a child will be infected again with another nephritogen germ, there is still a chance that the condition of GNAPS will occur again in the future. Penicillin can be combined with amoxicillin 50 mg/kg body weight divided by 3 doses for 10 days.</p><p>If allergic to penicillin, replace it with erythromycin 30 mg/kg body weight/day divided by 3 doses ((Newcomer et al., 2021); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani et al., 2022); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)). In the acute phase, low-protein (1 g/kgbb/day) and low-salt (1g/day) feedings are required. Patients who have a fever are given soft food until the temperature returns to normal. In case of anuria or vomiting, IVFD with a 10% glucose solution can be administered to patients without complications. If there are complications such as heart failure, oedema, hypertension, and oliguria, the amount of fluid given should be limited ((Hahn, Samuel, Willis, Craig, &amp; Hodson, 2020);(Kellum et al., 2021)).</p><p>In addition, treatment of hypertension is also necessary. For mild hypertension, antihypertensives are usually not given but need close observation. In moderate hypertension, diuretics are given with a minimum dose of 0.5mg to 2 mg/kg/dose or ACE inhibitors at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day divided by 3 doses. However, if this treatment does not produce the desired results, vasodilator-class antihypertensives can be given. Meanwhile, in hypertensive crises, vasodilators are given at a dose of 0.002 mg/kg / 8 hours or can be given sublingual nifedipine 0.25-0.5 mg / kgbb ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Brant Pinheiro et al., 2022)). Peritoneal measures of dialysis or hemodialysis may be considered in cases of acute renal failure ((Hahn et al., 2020);(Kellum et al., 2021)).</p><p>Complications that can occur include, oliguria to anuria due to decreased glomerular filtration (if oliguria lasts more than 2-3 days until anuria and is accompanied by symptoms</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 233</p><blockquote><p>An 8-Years-Old Child With Post Streptococcal Related Acute Glomerulonephritis Accompanied By Pleural Effusion: Case Report</p><p>such as acute renal failure with uremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis, peritonial dialysis or hemodialysis can be considered) ((Kellum et al., 2021); (Sethi et al., 2022)), hypertensive encephalopathy (localized vascular spasm with anoxia and brain oedema causing visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and convulsions) ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022); (Kondziella &amp; Waldemar, 2023)), circulatory disorders due to increased plasma volume in the form of dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, enlarged heart to heart failure (Rodriguez B &amp;; Mezzano S., 2009), anaemia due to erythropoietin formation disorders ((Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022)).</p><p>Most pediatric patients with GNAPS will recover, diuresis will become normal again on days seven to ten, and oedema and blood pressure will gradually become normal again. Within one week, kidney function improves and normalizes within three to four weeks. Within six to eight weeks, the serum complex normalizes. However, urinary sediment abnormalities will remain visible in most patients for months, even years ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Saha et al., 2022). In a study conducted on 36 individuals who developed biopsy-proven poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis, followed for 9.5 years, the prognosis for a complete cure was excellent, one patient developed hypertension, and two others developed long-lasting mild proteinuria (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />From the cases presented, there are indications that the patient suffers from acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GNAPS) with complications of bilateral pleural effusion.

It is caused by group A nephritogenic type beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteria, which trigger an inflammatory process in the glomerulus. Symptoms of GNAPS include gross hematuria, puffiness, and hypertension, as well as acute renal failure after streptococcal infection. Typical signs of glomerulonephritis in urinalysis, evidence of laboratory streptococcal infection, and low levels of C3 complement are indicative of the condition (Duong & Reidy, 2022).</p><p>In this study, we present a case report of an 8-year-old child who experienced bilateral pleural effusion and was diagnosed with GNAPS. The case report method was chosen to provide in-depth insights into the condition, and the data was sourced from the patient's medical record and supported by a literature review. The patient's medical record included clinical records, laboratory results, and radiological examination results related to cases of GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion in the child.</p><p>In the case presented, the patient experienced swelling throughout their body, reduced urine output, and reddish urine. They also complained of headaches and shortness of breath. The patient's history revealed that they had a fever, cough, and runny nose about a week before the swelling appeared. High blood pressure, positive undulations test, pitting oedema, and bilateral pleural effusion were also observed.</p><p>Treatment for GNAPS typically involves diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and symptomatic therapy. In cases of acute renal failure, peritoneal measures of dialysis or hemodialysis may be considered. The administration of antibiotics in the acute phase does not affect the worsening of the condition of glomerulonephritis but rather reduces the spread of Streptococcal infections that may still exist (Satoskar, Parikh, & Nadasdy, 2020).</p><p>In conclusion, acute post-infectious streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a serious condition that can lead to acute renal failure and other complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for managing the condition effectively (Mosquera-Sulbaran, Pedreañez, Vargas, & Hernandez-Fonseca, 2023). This case report provides valuable insights into the presentation, diagnosis, and management of GNAPS in the pediatric population.</p><p><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong><br />This study adopted the case report method conducted on an 8-year-old child with a diagnosis of acute post-infectious streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GNAPS) and experienced bilateral pleural effusion. The case report method was chosen to focus on in-depth investigations into specific cases that can provide valuable insights into understanding the condition. The object of this study was an 8-year-old child with GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion.</p><p>The source of this study data involved the patient's medical record, including clinical records, laboratory results, and radiological examination results related to cases of GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion in the child. In addition, to support the analysis, a literature review was also conducted using the PubMed database to gain broader insight into GNAPS in the pediatric population.</p><p>The population that was the focus of this study was children with GNAPS, while the sample studied was a specific case of an 8-year-old child with GNAPS and bilateral pleural effusion. Research techniques and tools include collecting medical data from patient medical records, including physical examination, laboratory results, and radiological results. Data analysis techniques involve in-depth evaluation of the patient's clinical and laboratory data, as well as benchmarking with findings from literature reviews that have been conducted to present comprehensive information about the case.</p><p>Thus, this study not only describes a specific case of GNAPS with bilateral pleural effusion in an 8-year-old child but also provides a supportive literature review to enrich the understanding of the case in the context of the pediatric population.</p><p><strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong><br />In this study, it was found that patients experienced swelling throughout their bodies, namely the face, both hands and feet, including the testicles. In addition, the patient's urine is also reduced (oliguria) and becomes reddish (hematuria). Patients also complain of headaches and shortness of breath. From previous history, it is known that patients experience fever, cough, and runny nose about a week before swelling appears. In addition, high blood pressure of 150/110 mmHG (hypertension), positive undulations test, pitting oedema in the periorbita, both legs and scrotum. As well as obtained x-ray results of bilateral pleural effusion thorax, laboratory results of BUN (91) and ASTO (159.26) increased, but GFR (75) and C3c (43.3) decreased, and urinalysis results obtained erythrocytes +2 on the dipstick and 1-3 / LP in sediment. Treatment consists of diuretics and calcium channel blockers, followed by symptomatic therapy and diet management.</p><p><strong>Case Report</strong><br /><strong>Identity</strong><br />a.An. ASP, 8 years old, Male, Lamongan<br />b.Mr. S, 48 years old, Private<br />c.Mrs. S, 46 years old, Housewife<br /><strong>Anamnesis</strong><br />Main Complaint: Swelling all over the body for one week before being taken to the hospital. The patient is a referral from a type C hospital in one of the districts in East Java Province. The patient had swelling all over the body for one week before being taken to the hospital. Initially, the patient only experienced swelling of the eyes, especially in the morning, and slightly deflated during the day. By the time he arrived at the emergency department, there was swelling all over the face, both hands and feet and the patient's testicles. Patients also complain of shortness of breath at the beginning of the appearance of swelling, which is felt increasingly aggravated so that the patient is more comfortable in a half-sitting position. About a week before the swelling occurred, the patient developed a fever accompanied by a cough and runny nose but recovered after 5 days of taking antibiotics. When there begins to be swelling, the patient's urine becomes slight and reddish. In addition, patients also often complain of headaches. A previous history of shortness of breath was denied. A history of shortness of breath during activity is also denied. There is no history of morning sneezing and yellow eyes. There are no complaints of difficult farting or defecation. Patients have received prednisone tablets at a dose of 2 mg (5-5-4), NSAID type mefenamic acid 3x1 tablets, furosemide half tablets 24 hours, and captopril 3x12.5 mg, but there has been no improvement after treatment for 7 days. The patient was born normally, full-term, assisted by a midwife with a birth weight of 3800 grams, crying immediately, not blue and not yellow. At the time of pregnancy, the patient's mother routinely controls the village midwife and does not experience any complaints. Patients have the same history of growth and development as their peers. Patients can prop their heads at 3 months of age, lie on their stomachs at 6 months of age, sit at 9 months of age, stand at 12 months of age and walk at 16 months of age. Patients can play stacking cubes or play ball at 23 months of age. Patients can talk at the age of 2 years, and until now patients are known to communicate well in the environment around home and school. In infancy, patients do not get breast milk intake, so patients get nutrition from formula milk alone from the age of 0 months to 2 years with sufficient frequency and amount. Patients begin to get MP-ASI at the age of 6 months with a balanced type and amount. Patients from the age of 1 year begin to eat a balanced adult diet and have no history of allergy to chicken, eggs, or fish. </p><p>The patient has no history of allergies to food, dust, smoke, or drugs. The patient also had no history of congenital heart disease. From birth to the present, the patient has never been hospitalized, nor has he had a history of previous surgery. The patient's previous immunization history can also be said to be complete, namely BCG and measles immunization once and DPT, Hepatitis B, and polio immunization 3 times. In the patient's family, no one has the same history of illness as the patient is currently experiencing. However, the patient's grandmother had a history of heart disease.</p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 228</p><p>Yuan Agita Aprilia R1*, Adivia Cheries D2</p><p>The patient is currently in elementary school.

On day 5 of treatment, the patient had no complaints of fever, cough, runny nose, tightness, and headache, but still found swelling in both legs and scrotum, which was decreasing.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />The inflammatory process in the glomerulus caused by certain bacterial or viral infections is known as acute glomerulonephritis (GNA), and if it occurs after infection from group A nephritogenic beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteria is called acute post-infectious streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GNAPS). The incidenceof GNAPS is also influenced by climate, nutrition, general state, and history of allergies ((Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani, Aziz, &amp; Amanullah, 2022)).</p><p>Although streptococcal bacteria do not damage the kidneys directly, GNAPS produce antigen-antibody complexes that circulate to the glomerulus, where they are mechanically trapped in the basement membrane ((Mosquera &amp;Pedreañez, 2021); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022)). Complement will fixate, causing injury and inflammation, then polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelets will be attracted to the injured area. The endothelium and glomerular basement membrane (IGBM) are also damaged by phagocytosis and the release of lysosomal enzymes, and the proliferation of endothelial, mesangium, and epithelial cells appear in response to damage.</p><p>Increased leakage of glomerulus capillaries allows proteins and erythrocytes to enter the urine, causing proteinuria and hematuria. On microscopic examination, the glomerulus appears swollen and hypercellular with PMN invasion, and antigen-antibody complement complexes appear as subepithelial nodules as granular and lumpy ((Ge et al., 2020); (Glomerulopathy, Glomerulopathy, &amp; Glomerulopathy, 2023); (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)).GNAPS occurs due to type III hypersensitivity reactions. In this reaction, the immune complex attacks the streptococcal nephritogenic antigens that settle in the basement membrane of the glomerulus and involve activation of complement.</p><p>Complement activation mainly occurs through alternative pathways, but activation of the classical pathway also occurs due to the binding of immunoglobulin proteins on the surface of streptococci. ((Syed, Viazmina, Mager,Meri, &amp; Haapasalo, 2020); (Zhang et al., 2023)). Blood pressure in glomerular capillaries is almost four times higher than in other capillaries, causing deposits in the immune complex. Deposits are also more abundant in branching areas, where blood flow turbulence occurs ((Sethi, De Vriese, &amp; Fervenza, 2022); (Köppl &amp; Helmig, n.d.)).</p><p>The nature of antigens in the immune complex and antigens against their antibodies is associated with the nature of certain tissues. Cationic antigens will attach to anionic areas of the basal membrane, usually in the subepithelial. IgM and IgG immune complexes more often settle in the glomerulus as they flow through the glomerulus, larger immune complexes will collect between the endothelium and the basement membrane, and smaller immune complexes will penetrate the basement membrane and attach to epithelial cells ((Matsumoto et al., 2022)). The cell-mediated mechanism also plays a role in the formation of GNAPS. Glomerular infiltration by lymphocyte cells and macrophages has long been known to play a role in the cause of GNAPS. Lymphocyte intercellular spring molecules such as ICAM-I and LFA are found in the glomerulus and tubulointerstitial and are associated with infiltration and inflammation rates ((Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)).</p><p>GNAPS has varying clinical characteristics. Children usually show mild symptoms, but it is not uncommon for them to show severe symptoms. As mentioned earlier, damage to the walls of glomerulus capillaries leads to flesh-red albuminuria and hematuria. Urine may be</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 231</p><blockquote><p>An 8-Years-Old Child With Post Streptococcal Related Acute Glomerulonephritis Accompanied By Pleural Effusion: Case Report</p><p>reddish or coffee-coloured and is sometimes accompanied by mild oedema around the eyes or up to the entire body. Oliguria and heart failure usually cause severe oedema. A decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the cause of oedema, which causes reduced excretion of water, sodium, and nitrogen, causing oedema and azotemia. Increased aldosterone can also affect water and sodium retention ((Colvin, Chang, &amp; Cornell, 2023); (Bertschi, 2020); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022)). An increase in the hormone aldosterone can affect sodium and water retention. Although oedema is most common in the lower limbs by noon, oedema of the face, especially the periorbita, often occurs in the morning ((Lombel, Brakeman, Sack, &amp; Butani, 2022)). On the first day of GNA, 60-70% of children develop hypertension, but by the end of the first week, it returns to normal ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)). Blood pressure will remain high for several weeks and become permanent if kidney tissue damage persists. On the first day, the body temperature may be rather high. When there are no other symptoms of infection before, sometimes heat symptoms are still present. People with GNA often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, no appetite, constipation, and diarrhoea ((Rajindrajith, Devanarayana, Chanpong, &amp; Thapar, 2020); (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023)).</p><p>Urinalysis showed that almost 50% of patients had macroscopic hematuria, proteinuria (+1 to +4), urinary sediment abnormalities with dysphoric erythrocytes and leukocyturia, as well as luletal thoracic, granular, erythrocytes (++), albumin (+), and leukocyte cylinders (++), among others. Signs of kidney failure such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia sometimes make serum ureal and creatinine levels rise. Sometimes, the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome are accompanied by high proteinuria. During the first week, almost all patients showed low levels of total serum hemolytic complement (total complement hemolytic) and C3; however, the average C4 is low or drops only slightly, and in 50% of patients, properdin levels fall.</p><p>In this situation, an alternate path of the compound is enabled. In patients with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, the decrease in C3 is very pronounced, with levels between 20 and 40 mg/dl (normal values are 50 to 140 mg/dl). Increased C3 is not associated with disease severity or cure. Within six to eight weeks, complement levels will return to normal levels, but only for diagnosis of GNAPS ((Newcomer et al., 2021); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani et al., 2022); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)). In addition to antistreptozyme, ASTO, anti-hyaluronidase, and anti-Dnase B, several serological tests of streptococcal antigens can be used to determine the presence of infection.</p><p>Antistreptolysin screening is helpful because it can measure antibodies against various streptococcal antigens. Although some streptococcal strains do not produce streptolysin O, serum should be tested against more than one streptococcal antigen. However, anti-streptolysin O titers may be elevated in 75–80% of patients with GNAPS with pharyngitis. More than 90 per cent of cases show streptococcal infection after performing all serological tests. Although ASTO titers increase in only 50% of cases, antibodies to streptococcal antigens are usually positive due to anti-hyaluronidase or other antibodies. The titer test should be done serially because, at the beginning of the disease, the titer of streptococcal antibodies has not increased. If the titer increases two to three times, it indicates that there is an infection. Histopathological examination shows that diffuse glomerulonephritis occurs because almost all glomerulus are affected.</p><p>On macroscopic examination, the kidneys look slightly enlarged and pale, and there are bleeding points in the cortex as a result of the proliferation of strong glomerular endothelial cells, capillary lumen, and Bowman's closed hoop space. In addition, there is also</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 232</p><blockquote><p>Yuan Agita Aprilia R1*, Adivia Cheries D2</p><p>infiltration of monocyte cells, polymorphonuclear, and capsule epithelial cells so that the thickened basement membrane will look irregular when examined through an electron microscope. Streptococcal globulins, complements, and antigens can form hump clumps in the subepithelium (Khalighi &amp; Chang, 2021).</p><p>Patients who exhibit symptoms such as gross hematuria, puffiness, and hypertension, as well as acute renal failure after streptococcal infection, should suspect post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis. Typical signs of glomerulonephritis in urinalysis, evidence of laboratory streptococcal infection (ASTO more than 100 Todd), and low levels of C3 complement (less than 4 years or more than 15 years) have a history of disease with similar symptoms, accompanied by chronic renal failure, GFR below 50% of normal age, macroscopic hematuria more than 3 months or microscopic hematuria more than 1 year, C3 levels decrease over 3 months as well as refractory proteinuria.</p><p>Management of GNAPS patients is symptomatic and more aimed at preventing acute renal failure and eradication of the organism ((Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); Smith J.M., 2003; (Sikesa &amp; Loekman, 2020); (Ramdhani, Harun, &amp; Marlina, 2022)). Immediate medical care is required if symptoms of oedema, hypertension, or elevated blood creatinine are present. The patient does not experience a negative impact on the course of the disease after resting for three to four weeks, and can then begin mobilization after three to four weeks from the onset of the disease (Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023). Giving antibiotics in the acute phase does not affect the worsening of the condition of glomerulonephritis, but rather reduces the spread of Streptococcal infections that may still exist. In the acute phase, penicillin administration is recommended only for ten days.</p><p>However, after the state of nephritis improves (the causative germ decreases and disappears), the administration of penicillin for prevention or prophylaxis for a long period is not recommended due to the presence of persistent immune mechanisms. Although there is a small chance that a child will be infected again with another nephritogen germ, there is still a chance that the condition of GNAPS will occur again in the future. Penicillin can be combined with amoxicillin 50 mg/kg body weight divided by 3 doses for 10 days.</p><p>If allergic to penicillin, replace it with erythromycin 30 mg/kg body weight/day divided by 3 doses ((Newcomer et al., 2021); (Duong &amp; Reidy, 2022); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Moorani et al., 2022); (Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022)). In the acute phase, low-protein (1 g/kgbb/day) and low-salt (1g/day) feedings are required. Patients who have a fever are given soft food until the temperature returns to normal. In case of anuria or vomiting, IVFD with a 10% glucose solution can be administered to patients without complications. If there are complications such as heart failure, oedema, hypertension, and oliguria, the amount of fluid given should be limited ((Hahn, Samuel, Willis, Craig, &amp; Hodson, 2020);(Kellum et al., 2021)).</p><p>In addition, treatment of hypertension is also necessary. For mild hypertension, antihypertensives are usually not given but need close observation. In moderate hypertension, diuretics are given with a minimum dose of 0.5mg to 2 mg/kg/dose or ACE inhibitors at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day divided by 3 doses. However, if this treatment does not produce the desired results, vasodilator-class antihypertensives can be given. Meanwhile, in hypertensive crises, vasodilators are given at a dose of 0.002 mg/kg / 8 hours or can be given sublingual nifedipine 0.25-0.5 mg / kgbb ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Brant Pinheiro et al., 2022)). Peritoneal measures of dialysis or hemodialysis may be considered in cases of acute renal failure ((Hahn et al., 2020);(Kellum et al., 2021)).</p><p>Complications that can occur include, oliguria to anuria due to decreased glomerular filtration (if oliguria lasts more than 2-3 days until anuria and is accompanied by symptoms</p></blockquote><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 233</p><blockquote><p>An 8-Years-Old Child With Post Streptococcal Related Acute Glomerulonephritis Accompanied By Pleural Effusion: Case Report</p><p>such as acute renal failure with uremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis, peritonial dialysis or hemodialysis can be considered) ((Kellum et al., 2021); (Sethi et al., 2022)), hypertensive encephalopathy (localized vascular spasm with anoxia and brain oedema causing visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and convulsions) ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022); (Kondziella &amp; Waldemar, 2023)), circulatory disorders due to increased plasma volume in the form of dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, enlarged heart to heart failure (Rodriguez B &amp;; Mezzano S., 2009), anaemia due to erythropoietin formation disorders ((Sumarno &amp; Tjiang, 2022); (Mattoo &amp; Sanjad, 2022)).</p><p>Most pediatric patients with GNAPS will recover, diuresis will become normal again on days seven to ten, and oedema and blood pressure will gradually become normal again. Within one week, kidney function improves and normalizes within three to four weeks. Within six to eight weeks, the serum complex normalizes. However, urinary sediment abnormalities will remain visible in most patients for months, even years ((Mosquera-Sulbaran et al., 2023); (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021); (Saha et al., 2022). In a study conducted on 36 individuals who developed biopsy-proven poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis, followed for 9.5 years, the prognosis for a complete cure was excellent, one patient developed hypertension, and two others developed long-lasting mild proteinuria (Mosquera &amp; Pedreañez, 2021).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />From the cases presented, there are indications that the patient suffers from acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GNAPS) with complications of bilateral pleural effusion. GNAPS is a condition that arises after infection by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteria. This is in accordance with the patient's history which shows a history of fever, cough, and runny nose before the appearance of swollen symptoms.</p><p>The physical examination also indicates oedema throughout the body, high blood pressure, and bilateral pleural effusion. Laboratory findings, such as decreased levels of C3, hematuria, and proteinuria, also support the diagnosis of GNAPS. Based on the analysis of the examination and the findings, appropriate management should be given to the patient.</p><p>Management of GNAPS patients aims to control symptoms, prevent further kidney damage, and provide supportive therapy. Patients can be given antibiotics to treat infections that may be a trigger for GNAPS. In addition, diuretic therapy is given to reduce oedema, while the use of ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers can help control blood pressure. A low-salt diet is also recommended to reduce fluid retention. It is also important to periodically monitor the patient's kidney function.</p><p>In addition to pharmacological treatment, it is also important to provide non-pharmacological approaches such as educating patients and families about the importance of disease management and a healthy diet. Management of a low-salt diet, control of blood pressure, and periodic checkups are important steps in the long-term management of patients with GNAPS.</p><p>Therapy should be adapted to the clinical state of the patient, and it is necessary to conduct regular monitoring to evaluate the response to treatment and detect complications that may arise. With proper management, it is hoped that patients can recover from the condition of GNAPS and prevent further kidney damage.</p>"}]}

Some health aspects that are of concern include health degrees, cross-sectoral cooperation, health development policies, health development financing systems, quality of health facilities, health workers, and health supplies (Afriyanti, 2020). These health problems can affect the general public as well as certain groups such as infants, toddlers, pregnant women, the elderly, and workers.</p><p>In 2020, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak has brought significant negative impacts on various aspects of life. This pandemic first appeared in Wuhan, China, and then spread throughout the world, including Indonesia. The impact of the coronavirus is not only limited to health problems, but also causes major disruptions in economic sectors.</p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 206</p><p>Eliyah1, Setya Wijayanta2, Niken Aulia Putri3</p><p>On March 15, 2020, President Joko Widodo gave a press statement at Bogor Palace, West Java, regarding the Covid-19 corona outbreak. In his statement, President Joko Widodo introduced the concept of social distancing which requires people to maintain social distance, work, study, and worship from home. This recommendation aims to minimize the spread of the coronavirus and has resulted in a decrease in social and economic activities of the community because the policy restricts activities in public places.</p><p>Some companies have implemented work-from-home policies, while others have opted to lay off employees, even conducting mass layoffs. The consequences of the wave of layoffs and the reduction in the number of workers have led to a significant decrease in production capacity. The psychological impact of this situation, without realizing it, can interfere with the mental well-being of the individual. Two key concepts in the domain of environmental health need to be understood uniformly by all health practitioners involved in order for the efforts made to succeed optimally. Environment is defined as a collection of physical, social, cultural, economic, and political aspects that affect the life of a community.</p><p>Meanwhile, community health depends on the integrity of the physical environment, humanitarian principles in social interaction, availability of resources essential for survival and disease prevention, the ability to cope with health problems in a reasonable way, as well as facilitation in achieving work and education, preservation of cultural heritage, and acceptance of gender diversity, accessibility across generations, and feelings of control and hope. Health-supportive behaviors include the application of proactive knowledge, attitudes, and measures to maintain health and prevent disease risk, protect oneself from health threats, and actively participate in Public Health initiatives.</p><p>The mentality approach to the challenges faced has major implications for one's well-being. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community service activities present an educational forum where lecturers and students are able to present insights while training students' abilities in a greater capacity. This is done by being directly involved in actions to help communities in directly affected areas, in efforts to prevent and break the chain of the spread of COVID-19 while strengthening food security in local communities to ensure preparedness and resilient response to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Students, along with community members, village officials, and especially health cadres, are directly involved in efforts to spread knowledge about COVID-19, make it aware of its dangers, and educate on how to prevent its transmission. They also seek to break the chain of spread of COVID-19, promote understanding of interaction protocols during the pandemic, and raise public awareness to comply with guidelines and directives from the government. Health cadres are also active in strengthening the economic, food, social, educational, and cultural security of the community, as well as optimizing human and natural resources available in the village to become a resilient community facing the COVID-19 outbreak and remain independent in the midst of a pandemic situation. All these actions aim to improve the positive mindset of individuals in the face of the impact caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 207</p><p>Empowering cadres in preparing the community to face the new normal era in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City</p><p>The focus on handling the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted people's attention from the psychosocial aspect, which is the individual impact that may be faced due to the pandemic situation. Mental health issues arising as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to become ongoing problems and can pose a heavy social burden. It is stated that the public health emergency status established by global health agencies, followed by the enactment of social distancing policies, self-isolation, or quarantine, as well as reduced public mobility, can have a long-term impact on people's mental health ((Gao &amp; Sai, 2020); (Amin, Griffiths, &amp; Dsouza, 2020); (Spoorthy, Pratapa, &amp; Mahant, 2020)).</p><p>Despite volunteering, mobilizers of these health activities often face various challenges, such as degrading treatment or negative perceptions from the community. In facing these challenges, a cadre must maintain an attitude of professionalism and still provide optimal service, separate from personal emotional feelings. Increasing the role of health cadres in improving health services is one of the strategies in supporting citizens in maintaining their health, especially those who may experience psychological impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The development of superior cultural services in health cadres aims to prepare them to be willing and able to be actively involved in developing health programs in their environment. Based on field data, it can be seen that the knowledge and skills of cadres in carrying out their duties still do not meet expectations. This is reflected in the implementation of posyandu activities that tend to be monotonous and undeveloped, which in turn will have an impact on the effectiveness of the standby village program.</p><p>So far, posyandu cadres have played more of a role as implementers of activities than as posyandu managers, which should include planning and organizing activities based on their deep understanding of the needs of the community in their area. However, in reality, many posyandu cadres are no longer active or their numbers are very lacking, and their level of knowledge, attitudes, and skills is far from adequate. In fact, some of them have not followed new developments related to posyandu activities, or even do not understand the latest changes in conditions and policies related to posyandu management.</p><p>Given this situation, a Cadre Empowerment program is needed in Community Preparation to Face the New Norm Era in the Assisted Village of Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. Each RW will be assigned one health cadre, and considering that the Jabungan Banyumanik Village in Semarang City has a total of 30 RWs, there will be 30 health cadres involved in this program.</p><p>From this description, it can be seen that people's attitudes have a significant impact on how they overcome the challenges arising from the current pandemic. Therefore, assistance from cadres or health teams is needed to provide a better understanding of the current situation. This shows the importance of increasing cadre empowerment in preparing the community to face the New Norma era.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to actualize the commitment of Tri Darma of higher education through the implementation of community service activities, especially in preparing health cadres to face the New Normal Era in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. In addition, this study also aims to contribute from the Department of Medical Records &amp; Health Information Poltekkes Kemenkes Semarang to assisted</p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 208</p><p>Eliyah1, Setya Wijayanta2, Niken Aulia Putri3</p><p>villages as partners in the implementation of education. Thus, it is hoped that this research will have a positive impact in increasing the capacity of health cadres, educating the public about UPPM programs, and strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation between universities and the community.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong><br />The methods applied in this community service activity, employing participatory and descriptive approaches, aim to empower health cadres and facilitate community preparation for the New Normal era in the assisted villages of Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City. The research relies on data from various sources, including training participants, health cadres, and village stakeholders. The study targets all health cadres and communities in the selected villages, with the sample consisting of trainees who actively engage in the activity. Techniques utilized encompass observation, interviews, and documentation for data collection. Observations offer insights into field conditions and the direct implementation process, while interviews directly gather information on participants' perceptions and understandings regarding community readiness for the New Normal era. Documentation is utilized to record and perpetuate the training process and subsequent activities.</p><p>Furthermore, the data analysis method employs descriptive analysis, which involves elaborating and reviewing data from observations, interviews, and documentation. Collected data are meticulously organized and analyzed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of activity implementation and participants' perceptions related to community preparation for the New Normal era.</p><p>Acknowledging potential limitations in obtaining representative data, subjectivity in data interpretation, and potential errors in data collection, efforts are made to address these concerns through diverse participant inclusion, transparent methodologies, and rigorous validation procedures. Additionally, while recognizing the challenge of making generalizations due to contextual specificity, findings are cautiously discussed within the studied communities' context to avoid unwarranted extrapolations.</p><p>Lastly, evaluation occurs both pre- and post-material provision to assess the effectiveness of training and participants' understanding. Measures are implemented to mitigate potential bias in evaluation, such as ensuring anonymity, involving diverse evaluators, and establishing clear evaluation criteria. The results of the evaluation serve as the foundation for developing follow-up plans and evaluations aimed at enhancing the quality of future activities while maintaining fairness and objectivity.</p><p><strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong><br /><strong>Evaluation of Increased Cadre Understanding</strong><br />Each cadre has five different roles, namely: 1) Coach, tasked with helping identify obstacles faced, both inside and outside the work or life environment, evaluating the positive and negative sides, and finding possible solutions; 2) Motivators, seeking to provide support and strengthen psychological interactions between the attitudes, needs, perceptions, and needs of individuals, families, and communities before they take action; 3) Facilitator, serves as a tool to provide assistance to the subjects under </p><p>Jurnal Health Sains, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 209</p><p>Empowering cadres in preparing the community to face the new normal era in Jabungan Banyumanik Village, Semarang City</p><p>study in order for them to receive adequate services; 4) Catalyst, aiming to encourage changes to the problem under study in order to achieve the desired result; 5) Planners, tasked with formulating goals, needs, and targets to be achieved, as well as planning the implementation of social welfare services effectively and efficiently (Setianingrum, Desmawati, &amp; Yusuf, 2017).</p><p>Health cadres' knowledge of the new norm era will be evaluated before they receive training materials, known as pre-tests. The aim is to assess the understanding of health cadres about the daily behaviors needed in carrying out their duties in the new norm era after the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Table 1.

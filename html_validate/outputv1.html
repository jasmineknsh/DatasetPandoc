    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Modern society places special demands on a specialist with higher education, on the formation of his creative
        research potential. The formation of such a style of thinking is associated in pedagogical science with the use
        of new teaching technologies in the educational process of a university. Note that many of the technologies that
        are commonly called "innovative" in one format or another have already been used in the domestic education
        system in previous periods, but for a number of reasons were rejected by it. Decades later, they returned to
        them again.</p>

        Today, the project method is one of the most popular in the world, since it allows for a rational combination of
        theoretical knowledge and its practical application to solve specific problems of the surrounding reality in the
        joint activities of learners (schoolchildren, students, listeners). It is worth noting a number of points
        characteristics of the modern period of development of the project method in the post-Soviet educational space.
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, there is a rethinking and development of terminology. Currently, in addition to, and sometimes instead
        of the term "project method", such synonymous terms as "project technology", "project learning", "project
        methodology" are widely used. At the same time, one cannot but agree with E.S.</p>

    <p>Polat [2], who believes that there is often a confusion and even substitution of concepts. In recent years,
        almost any event has come to be called a project.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the project method is gaining more and more supporters. An analysis of scientific literature allows us
        to state the undoubted popularity of project-based learning ideas, both in school and university environments
        and, as a result, the unflagging interest of researchers in the problem under consideration over the past
        decades. The materials of the conducted research show that the project-based methodology has great potential in
        terms of developing the social and value qualities of the students' personality.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, it is no secret that the project-based methodology was initially conceived for school and tested
        exclusively within its framework. Its "testing" and positive assessment by school teachers contributed
        significantly to the fact that it was gradually transferred to other levels of education, in particular, to the
        activities of institutions of the diploma and postgraduate education system.</p>
    <p><strong>RЕSULTS АND DISСUSSIОN</strong><br />
        The conducted research revealed that the project-based learning technology has its advantages and disadvantages.
        Among the undoubted advantages of the group technology of project-based learning, experts include: broad and
        multifaceted interaction of participants during group work on projects, the formation of a group style of
        thinking and performance at all stages of the project, management of the design process and provision of
        pedagogical support to its participants, the ability to implement various types of projects and master the forms
        of their further promotion [3, p. 12].</p>
    <p>E.S. Polat believes that project-based learning develops in students:</p>
    <p>• research skills (the ability to analyze a problem situation, identify problems, select the necessary
        information from literature, observe practical situations, record and analyze their results, build hypotheses,
        implement, generalize, draw conclusions);</p>
    <p>• teamwork skills (there is an awareness of the importance of teamwork to achieve a result, the role of
        cooperation, joint activities);</p>
    <p>• communication skills (the ability not only to express one’s own point of view, but also to listen to</p>
    <p>and understand another’s, and in case of disagreement, to be able to constructively criticize an alternative
        approach in order to ultimately find a solution that synthesizes and retains the positive aspects of each
        proposal) [4]. Despite the prospects of the project method, its implementation has a number of limitations.
        These include: the lack of teachers capable of implementing the method; the lack of an individualized
        methodology for project activities for a specific teacher; excessive enthusiasm for the project method to the
        detriment of other teaching methods; significant time costs; unclear criteria for evaluating the results of work
        on a project; the inability to evaluate the real contribution of each participant in a group project; low
        motivation of teachers and students to implement the project method; insufficient research skills among
        students, especially in their first years at university; uneven mastering of the educational material,
        especially in comparison with the explanatory-illustrative teaching method [5].</p>
    <p>Today, project-based activities in the learning process are considered by scientists (V.P. Bespalko, G.B. Golub,
        N.F. Maslova, V.G. Navodnov, N.Yu. Pakhomova, E.S. Polat, S.A. Smirnov, etc.) as the most important method for
        successfully developing the professional competence of future specialists. Since one of the components of the
        professional competence of a future specialist is project-based (design) competence, the special significance of
        project-based learning is obvious. A university</p>

    <p>graduate must have knowledge of project-based activities and the ability to implement them at a</p>
    <p>professional level. Scientists believe that the process of effective development of project-based</p>
    <p>competencies of future specialists is possible when using project-based learning as a didactic</p>
    <p>technology and observing a number of pedagogical conditions: integration of psychological,</p>
    <p>pedagogical, subject and methodological knowledge; creation of a model situation of involvement in</p>
    <p>the design process (generation of the idea of project-based activities, development of the project</p>
    <p>concept and its implementation); use of various organizational forms and methods of organizing</p>
    <p>independent, educational activities of students and their support.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that the theoretical developments of domestic authors are based on local studies of</p>
    <p>the problem at experimental university sites. In this regard, the experience of teaching design</p>
    <p>accumulated by foreign universities is of undoubted interest. In a number of foreign universities in</p>
    <p>Finland, Denmark, Sweden, especially those with a technical profile, project-based learning is</p>
    <p>structured in such a way that, firstly, it involves mandatory completion of a semester group project,</p>
    <p>and secondly, an assessment of both the student's group work within the framework of a joint project</p>
    <p>and an individual contribution to its implementation. When a university relies on project-based</p>
    <p>learning, it is absolutely obvious that this requires a different organization of the educational process.</p>
    <p>One cannot but agree with the opinion of domestic experts who point out that building an educational</p>
    <p>process from the standpoint of project-based learning involves substantive and organizational</p>
    <p>transformations, a revision of the existing system of methodological support. In addition to traditional</p>
    <p>lectures and seminars, project-based learning should include such organizational forms as creative</p>
    <p>workshops, laboratories, and design bureaus.</p>

    <p>Thus, the project method developed at the beginning of the 20th century based on the pragmatic</p>
    <p>pedagogy of J. Dewey is becoming especially relevant in the modern information society. Interest in</p>
    <p>the use of project-based learning in higher education institutions in the post-Soviet space has</p>
    <p>noticeably increased at the beginning of the 21st century. The method is being rethought, modified</p>
    <p>and adjusted to suit the new conditions of functioning of educational institutions and the demands of</p>
    <p>the time.</p>

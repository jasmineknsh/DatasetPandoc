                        recovery” and, apparently, requires further correction of biochemical parameters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Rickets plays an important role in the structure of morbidity in young children and is a pressing problem in
    pediatrics [1,3,5,11]. This problem requires special attention to the problem of rickets, which has a negative
    impact on the reactivity of the organism, the course and outcome of somatic diseases, especially in children of the
    first year of life [2,7,8,10,14,18].</p>
<p>It is clear that the basis of any complex method of treating rickets is the use of vitamin D preparations. However,
    the data accumulated in the literature [4,12] indicate that in some children, course treatment with vitamin D
    preparations is not effective enough.</p>
<p>These data in the wider world reflect the experience of domestic and world practice, indicating that a number of
    manifestations of this disease are persistent and insufficiently correctable when treated with vitamin D
    preparations [13,17].</p>
<p>The schemes proposed by a number of authors [16,18] using various dosage forms and dosages of vitamin D, as a rule,
    do not lead to complete recovery by the end of the course of treatment and, at the same time, in some cases it is
    accompanied by the occurrence of complications - manifestations of hypervitaminosis D [6,9].</p>

<p>The traditional treatment complex for rickets, along with drugs with a specific effect (group D vitamins), includes
    pharmacological agents for pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy (group B vitamins, ascorbic acid, calcium gluconate,
    and others) against the background of the mandatory widespread use of a complex of nonspecific measures that provide
    optimal conditions for harmonious development child's body. This is a properly organized regime, strict observance
    of sanitary and hygienic standards for child care, rational nutrition [18-23].</p>
<p>Specific therapy for rickets, against the background of the described complex of non-specific measures, was carried
    out with a 0.5% alcohol solution of vitamin D.</p>
<p>With rickets of the I degree of severity, taking into account the nature of the course of the disease, patients
    receive 400-600 thousand IU of vitamin D per course. With rickets of the II degree of severity, the course dose of
    vitamin D increased to 600-800 thousand IU, which the children received in the acute course of 15-20 days, and in
    the subacute course of 45-60 days. In none of the observed cases, we noted increased sensitivity to vitamin D
    preparations, side effects and phenomena of D-vitamin intoxication.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-study">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h2>
<p>To study clinical and biochemical parallels in children through a comparative analysis of the clinical features of
    the course of the disease and the dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism in children with rickets.</p>
<h2 id="material-and-research-methods">MATERIAL AND RESEARCH METHODS</h2>
<p>We examined 47 patients who received traditional therapy. Of these, 11 children with rickets, 15 children with
    rickets aggravated pneumonia and 21 children with rickets aggravated pneumonia and malnutrition.</p>
<p>Analysis of fatty acids in blood serum was carried out by gas-liquid chromatography. Among the methods of
    chromatographic analysis, gas chromatography is promising due to its high separating power, sensitivity, and
    expressivity, becoming one of the most used methods in analytical chemistry [15].</p>
<p>We determined the qualitative and quantitative composition of fatty acids on a Tsvet-100 chromatograph, model 165
    with a flame ionization detector, in the laboratory of the Department of General Chemistry of Samarkand State
    University.</p>
<p>The determination of total lipids in blood and feces, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase was carried out
    using kits from Biolatest.</p>
<h2 id="research-results">RESEARCH RESULTS</h2>
<p>We analyzed the initial indicators of biochemical variants, which reflect the state of some indicators of lipid
    metabolism, as well as some features of their dynamics in children against the background of the traditional method
    of treatment. The results obtained are presented in the table and figure.</p>
<p>First, let us consider the dynamics of the studied indicators in the group of examined children. At the time of
    hospital admission, their total lipids were higher than control values (4.61 g/L) and amounted to 6.95 g/L total
    lipids (P &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>Р <strong>–</strong> significance of differences between indicators in the group of patients and healthy</p>
<p>When analyzing the fatty acid spectrum of the blood serum of the examined children upon admission to the hospital, it
    was revealed that almost all of its indicators are C (16:0), C (18: 0), C (18: 1), C (18: 2), C (18:3), C (20:4) had
    no significant differences compared with healthy children (P &gt; 0.2), (P &gt; 0.5) and only C (16:1) tended to
    decrease (P&lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>The content of total lipids in the feces of healthy children was 0.42 ± 0.05 g/kg, and at the time of admission to
    the hospital in children this figure was 0.85 ± 0.03 g/kg, which was higher than in healthy children (P &lt; 0.001)
</p>
<p>When the children were re-examined, out of 5-7 days of their stay in the hospital, it was found that the level of
    total lipids in the blood serum became equal to an average of 6.95 ± 0.3 g/l (P &lt; 0.001), the content of total
    fecal lipids (TLC ) decreased and was equal to 0.79 ± 0.03% (P &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>The content of C(16:0) tended to decrease and amounted to 27.50±1.43% (P&gt;0.5), while C(16:1) increased, it turned
    out to be 1.45±0.53% (P&lt;0.05) .</p>
<p>The level of C (18:0) in the blood serum decreased and averaged 27.88 ± 0.92% (P &gt; 0.2), while C (18:1) tended to
    increase and amounted to 0.66 ± 0.11% (P &gt;0.2).</p>
<p>The content of C (18:2) also tended to increase 30.10 ± 2.12% (P&gt;0.5), while C (18:3) decreased, averaging 2.44 ±
    0.48% (P&gt;0.2) .</p>
<p>The C(20:4) level averaged 2.32 ± 0.56% (P&gt;0.2) i.e. tended to decrease.</p>
<p>Further studies were carried out by the time the children were discharged. As a result, by the time of discharge in
    children of this group, the studied parameters were: the content of OL was 5.64 ± 0.3% (P &lt; 0.02), which was
    higher than in the control group. OLK decreased, the indicator corresponded to</p>
<p>0.71 ± 0.02% (P &lt;0.001).</p>
<p>The concentration of C(16:0) at the time of discharge was 28.96±1.28% (P&lt;0.001). C(16:1) was 1.62</p>

    <p>Figure. The dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism (spectrum of high fatty acids) in children with
        rickets, against the background of traditional therapy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can be seen from the table data, in children who received conventional treatment, along with a decrease in the
    clinical manifestations of the disease, there was a tendency to reduce the violations of some indicators of lipid
    metabolism, which is retained in sick children, despite the treatment.</p>
<p>Figure clearly demonstrates that the analyzed parameters changed quite differently, both qualitatively and
    quantitatively, even within the same link of lipid metabolism. The studies were carried out three times: upon
    admission to the hospital, on days 5-7 and at discharge from the hospital.</p>
<p>The stability of lipid dysmetabolism under the influence of the generally accepted complex of treatment is probably
    due to the fact that the effect of specific therapy in the body is primarily aimed at correcting phosphorus-calcium
    metabolism.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that the lack of noticeable positive dynamics of the fatty acid spectrum under the influence of
    generally accepted complex therapy makes it difficult to implement the action of vitamin D in the body, since it has
    been proven that under the influence of lipid dysmetabolism, there is a decrease in the level of
    1,25-dioxycholecalciferol in plasma, which is one of the most active vitamin D metabolites [1,10].</p>
<p>This is probably due to a violation of its renal metabolism in terms of lipid dysmetabolism. The redistribution of
    24,25-dioxycholecalciferol, which is important in the processes of osteogenesis, also changes in the tissues of the
    body.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>Our clinical observations and biochemical studies have shown that the use of conventional therapy for rickets did not
    adequately normalize the studied parameters of lipid metabolism, which is probably due to the stability of lipid
    dysmetabolism in the examined children.</p>
<p>In all observed children, after a course of conventional complex therapy, the parameters of the fatty acid spectrum
    of blood serum, the content of inorganic phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase activity, total lipids of blood
    and feces were studied.</p>
<p>Case histories of observed children with rickets are given as clinical examples of the therapeutic and biochemical
    effectiveness of the traditional method of treatment.</p>
<p>We believed that such a presentation of the materials of our own observations should most effectively and adequately
    reflect the reliability of general conclusions, conclusions and practical recommendations.</p>
<p>An illustration of the influence of the conventional therapy of rickets on the dynamics of the symptoms of the
    disease, the studied indicators of lipid, phosphorus-calcium metabolism in the blood can be the following our
    observations:</p>
<p>The child Farhod D., aged 6 months, was under observation in the children's polyclinic N 1 in Samarkand. The boy was
    born full-term from the 4th pregnancy and childbirth. The mother's pregnancy proceeded with toxicosis of the first
    half, which was manifested by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite. The mother received no treatment for this. The
    child's body weight at birth was 3400 g, height 50 cm. He was attached to the breast on the second day, sucked
    actively. The umbilical cord fell off on the 4th day and the child was discharged home in a satisfactory condition.
    From the age of 3 months, he was artificially fed. Specific prophylaxis of rickets was not carried out.</p>
<p>Complaints when examining a child for periodic anxiety for no apparent reason, sleep disturbance, excessive sweating,
    irritability, capriciousness, decreased appetite.</p>
<h2 id="сonclusions">СONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>In children with rickets after the traditional method of treatment, there was no normalization of some indicators of
    lipid metabolism. Along with clinical recovery, the content of some indicators of lipid metabolism, total blood and
    fecal lipids, remained elevated, which requires further correction of biochemical indicators.</p>

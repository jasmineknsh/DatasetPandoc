    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Up to the end of the school year, the sources of a child's perfection in all aspects of education are two types
        of activities. First, any child develops thanks to familiarization with modern culture, as if he had mastered
        the past experience of humanity. This process is based on educational activities aimed at mastering a child with
        the knowledge and skills necessary for society. Secondly, in the process of development, any child independently
        exercises his skills due to creative activity. Unlike education, creativity is not already focused on mastering
        certain knowledge. Didactic games help a child to realize his or her ideas aimed at demonstrating independence,
        self-awareness, and creating a new one. Therefore, educational and educational tasks in the educational
        hierarchy are solved in order to acquire some skills, to master it or this rule. Research and creative tasks
        will be solved to develop a child's critical thinking in the creative hierarchy. Therefore, if the ability to
        learn generally is developed in the educational process, then the overall ability to look for and find new
        solutions within the creative activities of the games, unusual methods of achieving the desired result, new
        approaches will be formed taking into account the proposed situation.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the current state of modern preschool education in our country, it is important to note that
        educational activities still occupy the main place. In teaching in two main academic subjects - language and
        arithmetic - children almost always solve educational and educational issues, both meaningful and typical
        problems. Their goal is to ensure that children's critical thinking develops as a result of their follow-up
        activities to each subsequent task of the same type. This is due to the formation of skills in solving certain
        types of arithmetic issues. In this case, the child will not look for a way to solve such problems, because he
        already knows it, but applies it. If, on the other hand, children developed a further search for solutions in
        solving each subsequent problem of a particular</p>

    <p>type, this means that they have badly mastered the knowledge that formed the basis of this type of problem
        solving method.</p>
    <p>The preponderance of work on mastering knowledge and skills in preschool education, in our opinion, hinders the
        significant development of children's intellect, primarily critical thinking. Children are trained to solve
        problems that have a ready-made solution and, as a rule, only one solution. Therefore, children are lost in
        situations where there is no solution to the problem or, conversely, there are many solutions. In addition,
        children are trained to solve problems based on the rule that has already been studied, so they work
        independently to find some kind of new way.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, constantly solving arithmetic problems develops a child's personality, especially his or her
        attitude toward himself. Gradually, children become accustomed to assessing themselves, their capabilities only
        by successfully or unsuccessfully solving typical problems, solving them depends on studying the relevant rule,
        the level of learning certain knowledge. Participating in the game, not just industriousness and diligence, the
        existence of a game situation, achieving the intended goal allows a child to evaluate himself, indicates its
        imagination, zukkoli.</p>
    <p>Success in nurturing has a significantly decisive impact on the relationship between children, which is often
        facilitated by educators. Children can be more respectful of well-educated and well-educated educators than
        those who think well. This is especially felt when smart kids read without the bleakness and curiosity. This
        adversely affects the formation of their character.</p>
    <p>However, it cannot be said that there are no functions of the search description in preschool education. Indeed,
        arithmetic has tasks known as non-standard, and solving them requires children to have intellectual initiative
        and critical thinking. But, firstly, solving such problems is available only to smart children, and not to all
        children, and secondly, solving these problems is optional.</p>
    <p>The process of creating scenarios (the content of the game) was carried out in a variety of ways: 1. The scripts
        were compiled by the trainer in conjunction with the trainer. 2. Scenarios are independently compiled by the
        children themselves. 3. Scenarios are based on a certain system of fairy tales by a trainer.</p>
    <p>The organization of a didactic game by the trainer is carried out in three main areas: preparation,
        implementation and analysis of the didactic game.</p>
    <p>Preparations for a didactic game include: game selection: deepening and integrating knowledge, developing
        emotional abilities, activating mental processes (memory, attention, thinking, speech), and so on; set the match
        of the game to a certain age group; convenient time; choosing a place to play; number of players; preparation of
        material; training of educators and children.</p>
    <p>Conducting a didactic game includes: getting acquainted with the content of the game, material (theme); explain
        the progress and rules of the game; show game movements; determining the role of a trainer in the game;
        summarize the results of the game; at the end of the game, the trainer asks the kids if they like the game or
        not, and the next time they can play a new game promises to be fun too. Children eagerly await this day.</p>
    <p>For example, a child is given the opportunity to act at his or her discretion in a didactic game at his or her
        discretion. Tracking the game noted the following:<br />
        1. Whether or not a child has an interest in toys;<br />
        2. The nature of this interest: its level of severity, the selection of interest, the stability of interest; 3.
        The level of development of cognitive activity;<br />
        4. Use knowledge in the game;</p>

    <p>5. Total duration of a child playing with toys.</p>
    <p>Solving this mental task requires not only the active use of enhanced knowledge but also the manifestation of
        comparison, independent research, and zukkolik.</p>
    <p>Analysis of the game is aimed at identifying ways to prepare and conduct it: what methods are effective in
        achieving the goal, what has not worked, and why. This will help improve both preparation and process for the
        game, and then avoid mistakes. In addition, the analysis reveals individual characteristics of children's
        behavior and character and therefore properly organizes individual activities with them. Self-critical analysis
        helps colorize the game, enriching it with new material. We tested ten of the strongest winners of national and
        international tournaments. Analysis of the results resulted in the formation of a psychological portrait of the
        master of the didactic game, which should have the following qualities:<br />
        1. Strong emotion and self-control<br />
        2. The ability to distribute attention to externally interconnected objects<br />
        3. Sensitivity to Dynamic Situations<br />
        4. High level of intellectual development<br />
        5. Abstract Thinking Ability<br />
        6. Ability to think mathematics (we have arithmetic)<br />
        7. The Ability to Be Objective<br />
        8. The ability to notice the distance of objects<br />
        9. Discipline and will<br />
        10. Self-confidence<br />
        This work helped to develop the task of pedagogical experimental work, to develop a serious attitude toward this
        game, and didactic play was recognized as a way of developing intellectual abilities and self-government.</p>
    <p>During the experiment, statistical methods were used to determine the compatibility between the level of play and
        the player's results in six directions: general intelligence, ability to read and remember, grades (especially
        mathematics, labor preparation and drawing), and analysis of didactic games. As it turned out, levels of play
        are directly props to average results in these six directions.</p>
    <p>Our research has shown that didactic games develop all the characteristics of critical thinking in children who
        are taught. Didactic games develop the best skills of theoretical, logical and abstract thinking, memory,
        geometric imagination, creative sensitivity, zukkolik, attention, planning, and making decisions in a difficult
        situation. Based on the results of the experiment, we can emphasize that whoever plays didactic games better
        will have a higher academic performance in arithmetic. When we turn to a didactic game, we see that getting
        acquainted with and studying arithmetic will continue successfully.</p>
    <p>The first important indicator of the effectiveness of the process of preschool education and training is the size
        and quality of knowledge. Knowledge is the main foundation of human culture, on which any activities of people
        are carried out.</p>

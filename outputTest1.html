    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The rapid growth of scientific and technical knowledge, constant changes in
        the social and economic fields, as well as the information revolution have led to the fact that today
        professional communication is becoming an object of active study of domestic and foreign scientists. New
        discoveries and achievements, exchange of experience and knowledge contribute to the intensive replenishment of
        the vocabulary of national languages due to the formation of new terms. More than 90 % of new words appearing in
        modern languages are special vocabulary. The growth in the number of terms in various sciences is outpacing the
        growth in the number of commonly used words. Moreover, terms are beginning to actively penetrate the common
        vocabulary, and terminological problems have an impact on the entire language.</p>
    <p>That is why the most important thing for language development is to study the situation in the field of special
        vocabulary, and further development of communication requires unification and systematization of the terms used.
        The second half of the 20th century is characterized by a strong development of terminological research, which
        led to the formation of a new science - terminology. Over time, terminology has grown into an independent
        discipline that combines such sciences as lexicology, philosophy, translation theory, linguistics and semiotics.
        Today, terminology is becoming increasingly attractive to researchers, and it is assigned one of the main places
        among modern</p>

    <p>scientific disciplines. Terminology is a branch of science that explores the semantic nature, grammatical
        organization and laws of functioning of terminologies in various areas of human professional activity.
        Terminology studies the patterns of development and use of special vocabulary, develops recommendations to
        address the shortcomings of creating, ordering, and using terms and terminologies.</p>
    <p>A term system is a complex hierarchical structure consisting of words and phrases that perform the functions of
        terms - elements of the term system. At the same time, the integration of these lexical units into rows of the
        same level and into multi-level paradigms is carried out artificially, using logical methods of analysis and
        synthesis. Thus, we can say that the term system is a natural-artificial formation, where the material is
        natural, and the ways of its organization are artificial. The term system is an ordered set of terms with fixed
        relations between them, reflecting the links between the concepts named by these terms. The term system 117 is
        characterized by a linguistic and logical system, which allows us to speak of the term system as a language
        model of a particular area of study.</p>
    <p>The works on streamlining and standardizing terminology began in the early 30s. More than 20 standards for
        terminology in various scientific and technical fields have been developed and approved. To ensure a unified
        methodological approach to standardization of terminology, a set of methodological materials has been created
        that regulate the procedure for developing and writing standards, compiling and maintaining terminological
        reference books. The methods formulate the following requirements for standardized terms: the term must be
        unambiguous, concise, systematic, correct from the point of view of linguistics, and derivative. However, state
        standards are not always used in the real language practice of specialists. This is largely due to the
        unexplored theoretical problems of terminology, namely, the difficulty of drawing the boundary between a term
        and a non-term, so the process of studying the relationship between a word and a term occupies one of the
        important places in terminology. Justifying the opposition of a term and a common word, it is necessary to
        define the word as a unit of language.</p>
    <p>A word is the smallest semantic unit of a language that is freely reproduced in speech and used to construct
        statements. The semantic structure of a word is described by a well-known semantic triangle in linguistics,
        where an object and a concept are distinguished: the word denotes the object and expresses the concept. However,
        nominativity cannot be recognized as a feature that separates a term from a word, since nominativity is a
        property of any language sign. Nominativity means the ability of a language unit to independently express the
        meaning associated with it regardless of combinations with other units, in distraction from its functional
        syntactic specialization. In most modern definitions of the term, the function of expressing a special
        professional concept acts as its main differential feature. A concept is an element of thought that reflects the
        features, properties, and relationships of displayed objects and phenomena of reality, and identifies the
        objects and the phenomena of the reality as independent objects.</p>
    <p>Common words express general ideas or everyday concepts, whereas terms express professional, scientific or
        technical concepts. Concepts are the result of generalizing items of a certain class by specific
        characteristics. The following examples illustrate the meaning and the translation of lexical units as common
        words and as banking terms:<br />1) accommodation - размещение/housing (a common word), кредит/a credit (a
        banking term); 2) quotation - цитата/citation (a common word), курс, котировка/a price (a banking term);</p>

    <p>The most important point in the cognitive study of terms and term systems is defining the central role of a
        person in the processes of cognition and formation of speech. In light of the cognitive approach to
        understanding the semantics of words an emphasis should be based on anthropo centrist thinking, language picture
        of the world language and lexical-semantic variants of the word. It is an indisputable fact that any meaning of
        the word does not come into the reality in the material form of ready-made knowledge. The meaning is formed only
        in the mind of the speaker and then the listener. It is a person who acts as an observer and a carrier of
        certain knowledge and experience, selects language tools for interpreting objects and phenomena of reality, and
        forms the values of special units.</p>
    <p>The cognitive approach allows us to reveal the causes and mechanisms of dynamic processes in the field of
        professional nomination, taking into account the changing cognitive and communication needs of people. In
        addition, this approach helps to form a more complete and comprehensive view of the term, since it takes into
        account the prototypical categorization and updating of the term in the field of special communication. In
        cognitive terminology, a term is defined as a verbalized result of professional thinking, a means of orientation
        in the professional sphere, and an important element of professional communication. The term implements the
        result of cognition of a special area of knowledge that defines the cognitive essence of the term.</p>
    <p>Moreover, terms perform a communicative function, since they are means of transmitting cognitive knowledge. From
        a communicative point of view, the term should be compact and convenient for use in professional speech. Due to
        its concise form, the term is able to convey a fairly large amount of knowledge.</p>
    <p>The study of term systems using cognitive semantic analysis allows us to more deeply examine the processes of
        their formation and functioning. The specificity of cognitive semantics lies in the fact that the central place
        in it is occupied by the anthropocentric factor, that is, a person who, in the process of his cognitive activity
        and due to cognitive abilities. Human cognitive activity (cognition) is aimed at exploring the world around us
        and developing the ability to navigate in this world using the knowledge gained, which is inevitably associated
        with classification activities, that is, the need to identify and compare objects and events. The central place
        in this classification activity is occupied by the processes of conceptualization and categorization, where the
        process of conceptualization is aimed at identifying the minimum meaningful units of human experience, and the
        process of categorization is aimed at combining similar units in categories. When describing the processes of
        conceptualization and categorization, it is necessary to define a concept and a category. Concept is a term that
        serves to explain the units of our consciousness and the information structure that reflects the knowledge and
        experience of a person; operational content unit of memory, mental lexicon, conceptual system and language of
        the brain, the whole picture of the world reflected in the human psyche [4]. Concepts represent the meanings
        that a person uses in the process of thinking, they reflect the experience, knowledge, the result of human
        activity and processes of knowledge of the world. The emergence of the concept is associated with the need to
        identify and distinguish objects of the</p>

    <p>surrounding world in the process of cognitive activity. The concept brings together all the variety of the
        objects and phenomena being observed and imagined. In each concept, information about the world that is
        fundamentally important for a person is brought together, and at the same time, non-essential knowledge is
        discarded. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with everyday cognition performed by a person in the
        course of his or her daily activities. For this reason, the concept, which is the central unit of cognitive
        linguistics, relates mainly to the everyday experience of human interaction with the surrounding reality. Common
        words reflect everyday knowledge, through which special knowledge itself can be formed. The more structured the
        special knowledge is, the stronger the connections between terms in the term system are.</p>
    <p>The conceptual system is formed at the expense of initial or primary concepts, from which all other concepts are
        then developed. Concepts are constantly specified and modified under the influence of</p>
    <p>other concepts. For example, a term “account” is usually translated as “bookkeeper/бухгалтер”. On the other hand,
        when being a part of word combinations, it shows the specification, since it is enriched with additional
        characteristics: joint account - общий счет, blocked account - замороженный счет, correspondent account -
        корреспондентский счет, active account - активный счет, deposit account - депозитный счет, savings account -
        сберегательный счет.</p>
    <p>Summing everything up it is possible to conclude that the prototypical approach radically changes the previously
        existing ideas about the ability of a person to categorize the terms. Researching the processes of
        categorization of terms can be considered as a type of conceptual analysis, since this approach allows to
        identify various characteristics of concepts that are the basis of the meaning formation, but are not always
        obvious from the meaning of the word, and reveal themselves only at the functional level, namely in the
        statement. Языкознание Linguistics 122 At the same time, studying the principles and mechanisms of
        categorization of the language units makes it possible to identify and analyze their prototypical semantics in
        terms of their common properties with the prototype of the category. This feature is particularly important for
        research in cognitive linguistics, since it is the prototypical semantics of language units that largely
        determine their use in a sentence to convey a particular meaning. The analysis of prototypical semantics also
        provides a deeper understanding of the structure and content of concepts that underlie the formation of language
        categories, the principles of organization of these categories, and the mechanisms of interaction between
        cognitive and language structures in the process of forming the meaning of a statement.</p>

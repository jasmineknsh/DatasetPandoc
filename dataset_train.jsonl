However, traditional bakery products often undergo processing techniques that can diminish the bioavailability and functionality of these nutrients. The development of innovative methods to extract and concentrate these bioactive compounds from grains can lead to the production of BAAs that significantly improve the quality of bakery products. By integrating these BAAs into bakery formulations, it is possible to enhance the nutritional value, sensory properties, and shelf life of the final products. Moreover, these methods must be optimized to ensure that the bioactive compounds retain their efficacy during the baking process, which often involves exposure to high temperatures.</p><p>This research focuses on the development of such methods, with a particular emphasis on leveraging regionally available grains. The goal is to create BAAs that not only improve the health benefits of bakery products but also align with sustainability practices by utilizing locally sourced ingredients. Through this approach, the study aims to contribute to the broader field of functional food development, offering insights into how grain-derived BAAs can be effectively used to produce bakery products that cater to both nutritional needs and consumer preferences. This production provides the basis for the use of grains that are harvested as a source of biologically valuable components in the preparation of Functional Foods, which is one of the modern trends in food technology. In this study, a mixture of sprouted grains containing grains of wheat, oats, barley and corn that were floured in equal amounts was used as an unconventional raw material[3].</p><p>This mixture of germinated grains contains vitamins (A, YE, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, n, choline, RR), trace elements (boron, molybdenum, selenium, chromium, iron, vanadium, manganese, zinc, iodine, copper, fluorine), minerals (potassium, calcium, silicon, magnesium, phosphorus), essential amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine) and enzymes (lipase, proteases, phosphatases, α - and β-amylases), have been found to be rich[4]. According to the results of test baking in our preliminary studies, it was recommended to add a mixture of grains, which were ground to a higher grade of flour weight in an amount of 15% to improve the nutritional and biological value of bread. It has been found that adding a mixture of flour-infused grains to wheat flour reduces bread size and its porosity. The use of BAA in the production of bakery products makes it possible to eliminate the negative impact of unconventional raw materials on the quality of dough and bread, as well as activate the technological process, prolong the novelty life of Bakery Products.</p><p>To increase the quality of prolonging the freshness of products made with the addition of a mixture of whole grains, it is recommended to use multicomponent bread enhancers containing minerals (wheat flour, soy flour, starch), oxidants, reducing agents, enzymes, emulsifiers, ground wheat flour, ground wheat extract, improved starches, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate, calcium phosphate, ammonium chloride, carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose), lecithin, soy flour, dry milk, vegetable protein) and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The purpose of the study is to develop a multicomponent cooking improvement tool that increases the quality of the product and prolongs their novelty life, by using a mixture of wheat, oats, corn and barley grain in wheat flour. To improve multicomponent cooking, bfq-quality components belonging to food additives, generally recognized as safe, were used.</p><p>Development of multicomponent baking enhancing additives to preserve the hissium properties of bread made from wheat flour and prolong its freshness with the addition of a flour mixture.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>6</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p><strong>ATERIALS AND METHODS</strong><br />The development of the improving composition of multicomponent baking was carried out using the effect of individual food additives on the quality of bread. The flour from the ground wheat was assessed for its effect on the porosity of the bread, the change in fracture deformation, the formation of the upper layer and the accumulation of chissium and dextrins in the bread.</p><p>The study used a sprouted mixture of wheat, oats, barley and corn grains produced in the Department of” food safety and functional products technology\".</p><p>The dough is made from high-grade wheat flour, the dough samples are prepared according to the recipe, in gram: high-grade wheat flour, 100gr; pressed yeast, 3GR; salt, 1.5 gr; ground flour mixture of wheat, oats, barley and corn grains, 15gr. The dough is kneaded in a two-speed mixer mixing machine (Russia), dressing a uniform mixture with a moisture content of 44.0%. The fermentation period was carried out in a 20-minute tin. Dough processing was carried out manually, the inspection was carried out at a temperature of 40 ± 2 °C and at a relative humidity of 82 ± 2% until it was ready. The bread was baked in an artel oven (Uzbekistan) in a baking chamber moistened at a temperature of 210-220 °C for 28 minutes. All experiments were carried out in at least three copies.</p><p><strong>Results and their discussion</strong><br />BAA is enriched in whey powder, wheat protein powder, tapinambur inulin, carboxymethylcellulose, lactic acid. In bread-making technology, wheat flour, which was floured into the flour mixture, was introduced in 15% quantities, and this mixture was found to be acceptable in 1.8% quantities as an additive that improved multicomponent baking displays.</p><p>The addition of BAA provides the organoleptic properties and specific volume of bread enriched with a mixture of flour, which is no different from control. The introduction of a multicomponent baking enhancer increases the overall, plastic and elastic deformations of breadcrumbs, reducing fracture markers and layer thickness under the crust. The deformation of breadcrumbs enriched with a mixture of ground grain and a developed multicomponent baking enhancer was twice that of control (wheat bread) after 72 hours of storage. The addition of a multicomponent baking enhancer to bread containing a 15% uncooked grain mixture to flour weight increased the accumulation of low molecular weight dextrins by 77.6% compared to control.</p><p><strong>1-Table.

The incorporation of this enhancer into bread-making processes yielded multiple benefits, addressing critical factors such as texture, volume, moisture retention, and the overall sensory attributes of the final product.</p><p>One of the primary findings of this study was the positive impact of the multicomponent baking enhancer on the structural properties of bread. The introduction of a 15% germinated grain mixture into the wheat flour, complemented by the BAA, resulted in a marked increase in the plastic and elastic deformation of breadcrumbs. This improvement is crucial, as it directly correlates with the bread’s ability to maintain its softness and resilience over time, reducing the brittleness often associated with extended storage. Notably, the deformation of breadcrumbs enriched with the BAA was twice that of the control wheat bread after 72 hours of storage, highlighting the enhancer's effectiveness in preserving bread quality.</p><p>The addition of the BAA also had a significant influence on the organoleptic properties of the bread. Despite the inclusion of a complex mixture of ingredients, the bread's specific volume and sensory characteristics remained consistent with that of the control, indicating that the enhancer did not adversely affect the bread's traditional qualities. This finding is particularly important for consumer acceptance, as it ensures that the nutritional enhancements do not come at the expense of the bread’s familiar taste and texture.</p><p>The application of such enhancers in the bakery industry has the potential to meet consumer demands for higher-quality, more nutritious, and longer-lasting bread products, ultimately leading to broader adoption in commercial baking practices<strong>.</strong>The use of a developed multicomponent baking improvement tool has a positive effect on the quality of wheat bread enriched with a mixture of germinated grains and prolongs the freshness of bread to 72 hours without packaging.</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br />1.

The formation of such a style of thinking is associated in pedagogical science with the use of new teaching technologies in the educational process of a university. Note that many of the technologies that are commonly called \"innovative\" in one format or another have already been used in the domestic education system in previous periods, but for a number of reasons were rejected by it. Decades later, they returned to them again.</p><p><strong>MАTЕRIАLS АND MЕTHОDS</strong><br />Today, the project method is one of the most popular in the world, since it allows for a rational combination of theoretical knowledge and its practical application to solve specific problems of the surrounding reality in the joint activities of learners (schoolchildren, students, listeners). It is worth noting a number of points characteristics of the modern period of development of the project method in the post-Soviet educational space.</p><p>Firstly, there is a rethinking and development of terminology. Currently, in addition to, and sometimes instead of the term \"project method\", such synonymous terms as \"project technology\", \"project learning\", \"project methodology\" are widely used. At the same time, one cannot but agree with E.S.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>10</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>Polat [2], who believes that there is often a confusion and even substitution of concepts. In recent years, almost any event has come to be called a project.</p><p>Secondly, the project method is gaining more and more supporters. An analysis of scientific literature allows us to state the undoubted popularity of project-based learning ideas, both in school and university environments and, as a result, the unflagging interest of researchers in the problem under consideration over the past decades. The materials of the conducted research show that the project-based methodology has great potential in terms of developing the social and value qualities of the students' personality.</p><p>Thirdly, it is no secret that the project-based methodology was initially conceived for school and tested exclusively within its framework. Its \"testing\" and positive assessment by school teachers contributed significantly to the fact that it was gradually transferred to other levels of education, in particular, to the activities of institutions of the diploma and postgraduate education system.</p><p><strong>RЕSULTS АND DISСUSSIОN</strong><br />The conducted research revealed that the project-based learning technology has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the undoubted advantages of the group technology of project-based learning, experts include: broad and multifaceted interaction of participants during group work on projects, the formation of a group style of thinking and performance at all stages of the project, management of the design process and provision of pedagogical support to its participants, the ability to implement various types of projects and master the forms of their further promotion [3, p. 12].</p><p>E.S. Polat believes that project-based learning develops in students:</p><p>• research skills (the ability to analyze a problem situation, identify problems, select the necessary information from literature, observe practical situations, record and analyze their results, build hypotheses, implement, generalize, draw conclusions);</p><p>• teamwork skills (there is an awareness of the importance of teamwork to achieve a result, the role of cooperation, joint activities);</p><p>• communication skills (the ability not only to express one’s own point of view, but also to listen to and understand another’s, and in case of disagreement, to be able to constructively criticize an alternative approach in order to ultimately find a solution that synthesizes and retains the positive aspects of each proposal) [4]. Despite the prospects of the project method, its implementation has a number of limitations. These include: the lack of teachers capable of implementing the method; the lack of an individualized methodology for project activities for a specific teacher; excessive enthusiasm for the project method to the detriment of other teaching methods; significant time costs; unclear criteria for evaluating the results of work on a project; the inability to evaluate the real contribution of each participant in a group project; low motivation of teachers and students to implement the project method; insufficient research skills among students, especially in their first years at university; uneven mastering of the educational material, especially in comparison with the explanatory-illustrative teaching method [5].</p><p>Today, project-based activities in the learning process are considered by scientists (V.P. Bespalko, G.B. Golub, N.F. Maslova, V.G. Navodnov, N.Yu. Pakhomova, E.S. Polat, S.A. Smirnov, etc.) as the most important method for successfully developing the professional competence of future specialists. Since one of the components of the professional competence of a future specialist is project-based (design) competence, the special significance of project-based learning is obvious. A university</p><p>P a g e | <strong>11</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research</p></blockquote><p>Volume 28 September- 2024</p><blockquote><p>graduate must have knowledge of project-based activities and the ability to implement them at a professional level. Scientists believe that the process of effective development of project-based competencies of future specialists is possible when using project-based learning as a didactic technology and observing a number of pedagogical conditions: integration of psychological, pedagogical, subject and methodological knowledge; creation of a model situation of involvement in the design process (generation of the idea of project-based activities, development of the project concept and its implementation); use of various organizational forms and methods of organizing independent, educational activities of students and their support.</p><p>It should be noted that the theoretical developments of domestic authors are based on local studies of the problem at experimental university sites. In this regard, the experience of teaching design accumulated by foreign universities is of undoubted interest. In a number of foreign universities in Finland, Denmark, Sweden, especially those with a technical profile, project-based learning is structured in such a way that, firstly, it involves mandatory completion of a semester group project, and secondly, an assessment of both the student's group work within the framework of a joint project and an individual contribution to its implementation. When a university relies on project-based learning, it is absolutely obvious that this requires a different organization of the educational process.</p><p>One cannot but agree with the opinion of domestic experts who point out that building an educational process from the standpoint of project-based learning involves substantive and organizational transformations, a revision of the existing system of methodological support. In addition to traditional lectures and seminars, project-based learning should include such organizational forms as creative workshops, laboratories, and design bureaus.</p><p><strong>СОNСLUSIОN</strong></p><p>Thus, the project method developed at the beginning of the 20th century based on the pragmatic pedagogy of J. Dewey is becoming especially relevant in the modern information society. Interest in the use of project-based learning in higher education institutions in the post-Soviet space has noticeably increased at the beginning of the 21st century. The method is being rethought, modified and adjusted to suit the new conditions of functioning of educational institutions and the demands of the time.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p>"}]}

Psychological training is increasingly recognized as a vital element in preparing athletes for high-stakes competitions. This paper examines the psychological factors that influence athletic performance and how targeted mental training can enhance competitive outcomes.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Psychological Training</strong><br />Enhancing Focus and Concentration<strong>.</strong> Focus and concentration are critical for athletes during competitions. Distractions can lead to errors, affecting performance. Techniques such as mindfulness and visualization help athletes maintain concentration under pressure. In the high-pressure environment of sports competitions, maintaining focus and concentration is essential for optimal performance. Athletes often face various distractions, from the roar of the crowd to internal pressures and expectations. Psychological training provides tools to help athletes hone their concentration skills, ensuring they remain focused on their performance.</p><p>Mindfulness.Mindfulness is a practice that encourages athletes to stay present and fully engaged in the moment. By cultivating awareness of their thoughts and emotions without judgment, athletes can prevent distractions from affecting their performance. Regular mindfulness exercises, such as focused breathing and body scans, promote a calm and attentive mindset.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>14</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Benefits of Mindfulness</strong><br />•Reduced Anxiety: Mindfulness helps lower pre-competition anxiety, allowing athletes to enter events with a clear and calm mind.</p><p>•Improved Attention: It enhances the ability to concentrate on tasks, reducing the likelihood of errors during critical moments.</p><p>•Emotional Regulation: Athletes can better manage their emotions, preventing frustration or excitement from disrupting focus.</p><p>Visualization.Visualization involves mentally rehearsing successful performance scenarios. This technique helps athletes prepare for competitions by creating a mental blueprint of desired outcomes. By repeatedly visualizing their performance, athletes strengthen the neural connections associated with their skills, leading to improved execution.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Visualization</strong><br />•Enhanced Confidence: Visualizing success boosts self-confidence and reduces performance anxiety.</p><p>•Skill Refinement: Mental rehearsal allows athletes to fine-tune their techniques and strategies without physical practice.</p><p>•Situation Preparedness: Athletes can mentally prepare for various scenarios, increasing adaptability during competitions.</p><p><strong>Integration into Training</strong><br />•Routine Development: Athletes can incorporate mindfulness and visualization into their daily training routines, making these techniques habitual.</p><p>•Pre-Competition Rituals: Establishing pre-competition rituals that include mindfulness and visualization can help athletes enter competitions with a focused mindset.</p><p>Role of Coaches.Coaches play a crucial role in helping athletes integrate these techniques into their training.

Effective goal setting provides athletes with clear objectives and a sense of purpose. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals are particularly beneficial in maintaining motivation.</p><p><strong>Implementing Psychological Training</strong><br />Role of Coaches and Sports Psychologists. Coaches and sports psychologists play a pivotal role in integrating psychological training into an athlete's regimen. By providing guidance and support, they can tailor strategies to individual needs. Coaches and sports psychologists are central to the successful implementation of psychological training in an athlete's regimen. Their expertise and support are crucial in tailoring mental strategies to the specific needs of each athlete. Coaches provide direct, everyday interaction with athletes, making them instrumental in integrating psychological techniques into training. They help athletes apply mental skills during practice and competitions, reinforcing these strategies through consistent feedback. Coaches understand the unique demands of their sport and the individual characteristics of their athletes. This knowledge allows them to customize psychological approaches, such as visualization or goal-setting, to suit each athlete’s strengths and weaknesses. By observing athletes in various situations, coaches can assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions. They can adjust strategies as needed, ensuring continued progress and addressing any emerging challenges.</p><p>The collaboration between coaches and sports psychologists is vital for effectively integrating psychological training into an athlete’s regimen. By working together, they can provide personalized strategies and support that empower athletes to achieve their full potential. This holistic approach not only improves performance but also enhances the overall well-being of athletes.</p><p>Personalized Training Programs. Each athlete has unique psychological needs. Personalized training programs that consider individual strengths and weaknesses are more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches.</p><p>Monitoring and Evaluation. Regular assessment of psychological training programs ensures they remain effective. Feedback from athletes and performance metrics can guide adjustments to strategies.</p><p><strong>Case Studies</strong><br />Case Study 1: Olympic Swimmer. An Olympic swimmer used visualization and goal-setting techniques to overcome pre-race anxiety. By mentally rehearsing successful races, the athlete improved their confidence and performance.</p><p>Case Study 2: Professional Tennis Player. A professional tennis player benefited from mindfulness training, which enhanced focus during matches and reduced performance anxiety. The player reported improved concentration and decision-making.</p><p><strong>Challenges and Future Directions</strong><br />Overcoming Stigma. There is often a stigma associated with psychological training in sports.</p><p>Educating athletes and coaches about its benefits can promote wider acceptance and integration. Technological Advancements. Emerging technologies, such as virtual reality and biofeedback, offer new opportunities for psychological training. These tools can provide immersive and data-driven experiences for athletes.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>16</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 28 September- 2024</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Research and Development. Ongoing research is essential to refine psychological techniques and validate their effectiveness. Collaboration between researchers and practitioners can drive innovation in the field.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />Psychological training is a vital component of athletic preparation, enhancing focus, resilience, and motivation. By integrating psychological techniques into training regimens, athletes can achieve optimal performance.

This problem requires special attention to the problem of rickets, which has a negative impact on the reactivity of the organism, the course and outcome of somatic diseases, especially in children of the first year of life [2,7,8,10,14,18].</p><p>It is clear that the basis of any complex method of treating rickets is the use of vitamin D preparations. However, the data accumulated in the literature [4,12] indicate that in some children, course treatment with vitamin D preparations is not effective enough.</p><p>These data in the wider world reflect the experience of domestic and world practice, indicating that a number of manifestations of this disease are persistent and insufficiently correctable when treated with vitamin D preparations [13,17].</p><p>The schemes proposed by a number of authors [16,18] using various dosage forms and dosages of vitamin D, as a rule, do not lead to complete recovery by the end of the course of treatment and, at the same time, in some cases it is accompanied by the occurrence of complications - manifestations of hypervitaminosis D [6,9].</p><blockquote><p>P a g e | <strong>40</strong> <a href=\"http://www.americanjournal.org/\">www.americanjournal.org</a></p></blockquote><p>The traditional treatment complex for rickets, along with drugs with a specific effect (group D vitamins), includes pharmacological agents for pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy (group B vitamins, ascorbic acid, calcium gluconate, and others) against the background of the mandatory widespread use of a complex of nonspecific measures that provide optimal conditions for harmonious development child's body. This is a properly organized regime, strict observance of sanitary and hygienic standards for child care, rational nutrition [18-23].</p><p>Specific therapy for rickets, against the background of the described complex of non-specific measures, was carried out with a 0.5% alcohol solution of vitamin D.</p><p>With rickets of the I degree of severity, taking into account the nature of the course of the disease, patients receive 400-600 thousand IU of vitamin D per course. With rickets of the II degree of severity, the course dose of vitamin D increased to 600-800 thousand IU, which the children received in the acute course of 15-20 days, and in the subacute course of 45-60 days. In none of the observed cases, we noted increased sensitivity to vitamin D preparations, side effects and phenomena of D-vitamin intoxication.</p><h2 id=\"purpose-of-the-study\">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h2><p>To study clinical and biochemical parallels in children through a comparative analysis of the clinical features of the course of the disease and the dynamics of some indicators of lipid metabolism in children with rickets.</p><h2 id=\"material-and-research-methods\">MATERIAL AND RESEARCH METHODS</h2><p>We examined 47 patients who received traditional therapy. Of these, 11 children with rickets, 15 children with rickets aggravated pneumonia and 21 children with rickets aggravated pneumonia and malnutrition.</p><p>Analysis of fatty acids in blood serum was carried out by gas-liquid chromatography.

The use of bioinformational technologies for personality-developing education implies not just the concentration of knowledge and skills, but the mechanism of self-organization and self-realization of the future specialist, the formation of a flexible and constant, the emergence of his analytical skills and abilities. When applying such technologies, the educational environment creates much more free conditions. These conditions provide the student with the opportunity to choose an individual development trajectory, not having the same problem of normative construction of his activities.

Teaching on the basis of the style of projects increases motivation for studying, provides the basis for the formation of skills for cooperation and Inter-chassis communication, allows you to successfully adapt to the significantly changing conditions of human life in modern society. Students acquire the skills of transferring knowledge to another context, to a modified situation, trying not to simply memorize the facts, but to search for information, to carry it out analytically , tasks independently.

The position of the subject of knowledge is realized in the student if he: if he independently acquires new knowledge and uses existing knowledge creatively, using the experience of his personal life activity extensively; if he consciously chooses and actively uses methods of educational work that characterize not only the achieved result, but also the process of acquiring knowledge; makes independent and responsible decisions to choose the educational tools that apply to him, and thus actively influences what and how he learns; if he plans his educational work, analyzes, predicts and evaluates its results; if individual interests, taking into account needs, build cooperation relations with other people, respecting their national, spiritual, cultural traditions; when, in the process of working together, he coordinates his personal point of view with the opinions of others.</p><p>The professional reform function creates conditions for updating the knowledge of the learner and overcoming stereotypes of his experience, puts mechanisms for updating concepts formed in practical professional activities (as a result of personal experience, such as trying and making mistakes, victory and failure).

The first position figures define readiness, shaylik as a separate functional state, a psychological condition for the success of the activity performed against the background of the general activity of the organism, as opposed to the socially recorded instruction. Proponents of the personality approach view readiness as a complex intagral personality education.

Programming is related to the task solving process, an issue that the student implements. To solve the problem-tasks, he mentally looks for different ways, chooses suitable instruments or prepares them himself mutsaqil. Programming is a kind of knowledge of the world, in which the first plan comes out one or another issue-the search, formation of ideas and concepts that will be necessary for solving tasks. Learning begins with practical action and perception, moves from them to words and concepts, and ends with the development of some characteristic of the mental structure.</p><p>Educational tools used to form students analytical skills include the following components: training and production equipment as opposed to computers, in which learners develop professional skills and qualifications; educational and methodological support designed to support the course transition; electronic and educational resources and Internet resources.</p><p>As a result of the application of interactive technologies, the following issues of the educational process will find a solution: to increase the efficiency and optimality of mastering the educational material; to arouse the interest of the individual in the study of the subjects provided for in the curriculum, to strengthen motivation; to bring the educational information provided closer to the; teaching to respect the right of the participant who is working together to express personal opinion; the formation of life and professional skills.</p><p>Both practical classes and lectures are conducted in an interactive form.

When applying such technologies, the educational environment creates much more free conditions. These conditions provide the student with the opportunity to choose an individual development trajectory, not having the same problem of normative construction of his activities.

It allows you to ensure the systematic integration of scientific knowledge and practical actions, develop the interest of the learner in the process of obtaining independent knowledge and his reflexive positions in this process, build his own activities based on concrete practical requirements, form skills for establishing, acquire the experience of independent creative activity and conscious choice of ways of self-realization. Teaching on the basis of the style of projects increases motivation for studying, provides the basis for the formation of skills for cooperation and Inter-chassis communication, allows you to successfully adapt to the significantly changing conditions of human life in modern society. Students acquire the skills of transferring knowledge to another context, to a modified situation, trying not to simply memorize the facts, but to search for information, to carry it out analytically , tasks independently. As a result of training, it happens not only to master new knowledge, skills and abilities, but also to form analytical skills.

In higher education, the model for the formation of analytical skills of specialists in the field of bioinformative technologies I provides for the implementation of functions that activate the subject, professionally reform, are oriented towards practice.</p><p>The function of activating the subject determines the main role of the student as a subject of education in the educational process. In the process of interaction with educators, the student acquires methods of self-education, self-knowledge and self-realization. This function, when viewed from the position of each individual person, makes it necessary to provide pedagogical support for professional education, motivational and subjectively conditioned increase in its importance, to be prepared for it throughout life, the evolution of another position held by a person in all social processes, to change the status occupied by the learner in education. The position of the subject of knowledge is realized in the student if he: if he independently acquires new knowledge and uses existing knowledge creatively, using the experience of his personal life activity extensively; if he consciously chooses and actively uses methods of educational work that characterize not only the achieved result, but also the process of acquiring knowledge; makes independent and responsible decisions to choose the educational tools that apply to him, and thus actively influences what and how he learns; if he plans his educational work, analyzes, predicts and evaluates its results; if individual interests, taking into account needs, build cooperation relations with other people, respecting their national, spiritual, cultural traditions; when, in the process of working together, he coordinates his personal point of view with the opinions of others.</p><p>The professional reform function creates conditions for updating the knowledge of the learner and overcoming stereotypes of his experience, puts mechanisms for updating concepts formed in practical professional activities (as a result of personal experience, such as trying and making mistakes, victory and failure). In this case, it will be necessary to professionally train the future creators of software, taking into account the concrete sectors and IT sectors of the economy, based on the demand and their qualifications that are happening to them in the labor market.</p><p>The practice-oriented function reflects the presence of analytical skills in students in solving a problem situation, the need for a technological approach to tracing any professional situation in which a program of professional behavior is developed in relation to shui.</p><p>At the higher educational institution, the methodological basis of the model for the formation of the student's analytical skills is the field of approaches to the shasx, competency, technological and activity.</p><p>Within the framework of the approach towards the individual, the idea of the priority of the social, active and creative essence of the individual was decided, the development of the professional qualities of the shaskh was determined to be important, it was envisaged to take into account that the individuality of the future IT specialist is unique. Student-the main subject of the educational process. The student retains the right of educational work to the student to acquire knowledge, skills, establish his place in knowledge and realize himself by acquiring methods that provide adequate tools in their application in situations not foreseen in education.</p><p>A competency approach makes it possible to accurately determine the goals of pedagogical activity at a higher educational institution in order to ensure that the specialist is able to apply his analytical skills</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>in a consistent, consequential way, as opposed to the structural components of professional competence. A specific task, which is considered important in the profession, requires the future programmer to show competence when solving the range of issues on the basis of knowledge, skills, qualifications, abilities, guidance, values acquired during professional education.</p><p>The question of readiness for action is considered by researchers from two different perspectives: functional and personality-specific. The first position figures define readiness, shaylik as a separate functional state, a psychological condition for the success of the activity performed against the background of the general activity of the organism, as opposed to the socially recorded instruction. Proponents of the personality approach view readiness as a complex intagral personality education. Its components are considered the formation of psychic processes, States and properties of the individual.</p><p>Readiness to conduct activities provides for the presence in learners of the following structural elements: a positive attitude to various manifestations of activity, occupation; aspects of character, abilities, temperament corresponding to the requirements of activity, occupation; necessary knowledge, skills, qualifications; stable professionally significant characteristics of perception, attention, thinking, emotional and volitional processes.</p><p>As opposed to the integrated quality of the professional's readiness, shaylik is considered the main condition for the specialist's rapid adaptation to professional activities, adaptation, further professional growth and continuous, inexhaustible increase in his qualifications.</p><p>The technological approach implies the organization of such an educational process, in which the acquisition of ways and methods of organizing the process of formation of analytical activity skills, analytical skills is ensured through the implementation of a problematic, developing issue-tasks. Programming is related to the task solving process, an issue that the student implements. To solve the problem-tasks, he mentally looks for different ways, chooses suitable instruments or prepares them himself mutsaqil. Programming is a kind of knowledge of the world, in which the first plan comes out one or another issue-the search, formation of ideas and concepts that will be necessary for solving tasks. Learning begins with practical action and perception, moves from them to words and concepts, and ends with the development of some characteristic of the mental structure.</p><p>Educational tools used to form students analytical skills include the following components: training and production equipment as opposed to computers, in which learners develop professional skills and qualifications; educational and methodological support designed to support the course transition; electronic and educational resources and Internet resources.</p><p>As a result of the application of interactive technologies, the following issues of the educational process will find a solution: to increase the efficiency and optimality of mastering the educational material; to arouse the interest of the individual in the study of the subjects provided for in the curriculum, to strengthen motivation; to bring the educational information provided closer to the; teaching to respect the right of the participant who is working together to express personal opinion; the formation of life and professional skills.</p><p>Both practical classes and lectures are conducted in an interactive form.

Independent work of students in the university is an important type of educational and scientific activity of the student.</p><p>Independent work of students plays a significant role in the rating technology of education. The state standard provides, as a rule, 50% of the hours of the total labour intensity of the discipline for independent work of students. In this regard, education at a university includes two parts that are almost identical in volume and mutual influence - the learning process and the self-learning process. Therefore, the independent work of students should become an effective and purposeful work of the student.</p><p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong><br />The concept of modernization of education defines the main tasks of vocational education - \"training a qualified employee of the appropriate level and profile, competitive in the labour market, competent, responsible, fluent in his profession and oriented in related fields of activity, capable of effective work in his specialty at the level of world standards, ready to constant professional growth, social and professional mobility\".</p><p>P a g e | <strong>57</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The solution of these problems is impossible without increasing the role of independent work of students on educational material, strengthening the responsibility of teachers for the development of independent work skills, for stimulating the professional growth of students, fostering creative activity and initiative.</p><p>Society imposes a fairly wide list of requirements on a modern specialist, among which the graduates have certain abilities and the ability to independently obtain knowledge from various sources, systematize the information received, and evaluate a specific financial situation. The formation of such a skill occurs throughout the entire period of study through the participation of students in practical classes, the performance of control tasks and tests, writing term papers and final qualifying works. At the same time, independent work of students plays a decisive role in the course of the entire educational process.</p><p>➢management of independent work of students includes:<br />➢clear planning of the content and volume of independent work;<br />➢organization, control and analysis of the results of independent work;<br />➢the necessary educational, methodological and logistical support; introduction of new learning technologies;<br />➢accounting for the labour costs of students and teachers in the framework of independent work of students.</p><p><strong>METHODOLOGY &amp; EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS</strong><br />The main characteristics of independent work of students:<br />1. Psychological conditions for the success of independent work of students. First of all, it is the formation of a sustainable interest in the chosen profession and methods of mastering its features, which depend on the following parameters:</p><p>•relationships between teachers and students in the educational process; •the level of complexity of tasks for independent work;<br />•involvement of students in the formed activity of the future profession.</p><p>Like any kind of human activity, educational activity from a psychological point of view is a process of solving specific problems. The difference between educational tasks and any others is that their goal is to change the subject himself, which consists in mastering certain modes of action, and not in changing the objects with which the subject acts. The need for setting and solving such problems arises before the subject only if he needs to master such methods of action, which are based on generalizations of a theoretical type.</p><p>Considering educational activity as a process of solving problems, the following links should be distinguished. First, the setting of the educational problem. In psychology (pedagogical psychology) it is known that the goal arises as a result of concretization of meaning-forming motives of activity. The function of such motives can be performed only by interest in the content of acquired knowledge. Without such interest, not only the independent setting of the educational task is impossible, but also the acceptance of the task set by the teacher.</p><p>Secondly, the use of optimal methods for solving the problem.</p><p>There is a fundamental difference between educational activity under the guidance of a teacher and its independent forms, which is not paid enough attention to. When a teacher leads students from a concept to reality, such a move has the force of only a methodical device. When it comes to the</p><p>P a g e | <strong>58</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>formation of a concept through independent work with educational materials and means, the conditions for activity change drastically:<br />The first among these conditions is the formation of methods for logical analysis of sources of educational information, in particular, methods for logical analysis of information models in which the content of scientific concepts is fixed, which at the same time is one of the most important tasks of education, designed to prepare students for independent learning activities. The second important condition for the transition to independent learning activity is the mastery of productive ways of solving educational problems, and ensuring this condition is almost impossible without the active methodological and methodological participation of the teacher.</p><p>Thirdly, the implementation of monitoring and evaluation of the progress and results of solving the problem. The formation of control and evaluation operations should go from mastering the methods of monitoring and evaluating the actions of a teacher and other students through monitoring and evaluating one's own work under the guidance of a teacher to self-control and self-evaluation of independent educational activities.</p><p>2. Professional orientation of disciplines. The indisputability of this educational and meaningful thesis in terms of knowledge, involvement in creative professional activities, effective personal interaction in the profession should not detract from the importance of knowledge of the general humanitarian culture of the relevant blocks of disciplines in the curriculum.</p><p>In addition, the depth of profiling of certain disciplines should take into account the psychological patterns of the multi-level division of future professionals: bachelors, specialists, masters.</p><p>3. Limited student time budget.</p><p>Firstly, when forming the time volume of his subject, the teacher must take into account the total</p><p>workload of students outside the often very subjective opinion of the undoubted importance of “my” discipline.</p><p>Secondly, the intensification of the educational process involves the rhythm of independent work of students by reducing the student's routine work in semesters.</p><p>4. Individualization of independent work of students, which includes:</p><p>• increase in the proportion of intensive work with more prepared students;</p><p>• division of the lesson into compulsory and creative parts (for everyone trying to cope with more difficult and, most importantly, non-standard tasks, additional questions, educational problem situations, etc.)</p><p>• regular consultations with trainees;</p><p>• comprehensive and timely information about the thematic content of independent work, deadlines, the need for auxiliary tools, forms, methods of monitoring and evaluating the final results with a mandatory comparison with the expected ones.</p><p><strong>RESULTS</strong><br />Forms of independent work of students are various. They include:<br />- study and systematization of official state documents - laws, decrees, decrees, normative - instructional and reference materials using information - retrieval systems, computer network \"Internet\";<br />- study of educational, scientific and methodical literature, materials of periodicals with the involvement of electronic means of official, statistical, periodical and scientific information;</p><p>P a g e | <strong>59</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\\\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>- preparation of reports and abstracts, writing term papers and final qualifying works;<br />- participation in the work of student conferences, complex scientific research. Independent work introduces students to scientific creativity, search and solution of topical modern problems. The leading goal of organizing and implementing independent work of students should coincide with the goal of student education - the preparation of a specialist and a bachelor with higher education. When organizing independent work of students, an important and necessary condition is the formation of the ability to work independently to acquire knowledge, skills and the possibility of organizing educational and scientific activities.</p><p>The purpose of independent work of students is to master fundamental knowledge, professional skills and skills of activity in the profile, experience in creative, research activities.</p><p>Independent work of students contributes to the development of independence, responsibility and organization, a creative approach to solving problems of the educational and professional level. The tasks of independent work of students are:</p><p>✓ systematization and consolidation of the received theoretical knowledge and practical skills of students;</p><p>✓ deepening and expanding theoretical knowledge; formation of skills to use normative, legal, reference documentation and special literature;</p><p>✓ development of cognitive abilities and activity of students: creative initiative, independence, responsibility and organization; formation of independent thinking, abilities for self-development, self-improvement and self-realization; development of research skills;</p><p>✓ the use of material collected and received during self-study at seminars, practical and laboratory classes, when writing term papers and theses, for effective preparation for final tests and exams.</p><p>The technological chain of independent work of students is as follows: a teacher in a certain discipline determines three-level goals of activity (reproductive, productive and creative) and specific forms of work, builds a system of motivation for students, provides them with educational and methodological materials, sets the deadlines for intermediate reports on the work done, organizes activities of creative groups, gives an introductory lecture, conducts consultations, monitors the results of self-control and self-correction of students, evaluates the results of their work (individual or group).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />A prerequisite for ensuring the effectiveness of independent work of students is the observance of stages in its organization and conduct. The following stages of independent work of students can be distinguished.</p><p>The first stage is preparatory. It should include the preparation of a work program with the allocation of topics and tasks for independent work of students; end-to-end planning of independent work of students for a semester; preparation of teaching materials; diagnostics of the level of preparedness of students.</p><p>The second stage is organizational. At this stage, the goals of individual and group work of students are determined; an introductory lecture is given, individual-group installation consultations are held, during which the forms of independent work of students and its control are explained; terms and forms of presentation of intermediate results are established.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>60</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The third stage is motivational and activity. The teacher at this stage should provide positive motivation for individual and group activities; verification of intermediate results; organization of self-control and self-correction; interchange and mutual verification in accordance with the chosen goal.</p><p>The fourth stage is control and evaluation. It includes individual and group reports and their evaluation. The results can be presented in the form of a graduation project, term paper, abstract, report, diagrams, tables, oral communications, models, layouts, reports, etc. (depending on discipline and specialty). Control of independent work of students can be carried out with the help of intermediate and final testing, writing in the classroom of written tests, colloquia, intermediate tests, etc. The process of introducing independent work of students into the educational process should be gradual and justified. For the effective implementation of this type of activity, the readiness of the teaching staff, a high-quality educational and methodological and appropriate regulatory framework are necessary.</p><p>The readiness of the teaching staff should be understood as the ability of the teacher to highlight the most important and feasible topics for the students' independent work of the discipline (course); to stimulate the internal mechanisms of self-development of the personality, self-control and self-correction. At the same time, such a teacher should have organizational, predictive and constructive skills.</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br />1.Alikulov S. A., Rizaev I. I.

Independent work of students in the university is an important type of educational and scientific activity of the student.</p><p>Independent work of students plays a significant role in the rating technology of education. The state standard provides, as a rule, 50% of the hours of the total labour intensity of the discipline for independent work of students. In this regard, education at a university includes two parts that are almost identical in volume and mutual influence - the learning process and the self-learning process. Therefore, the independent work of students should become an effective and purposeful work of the student.</p><p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong><br />The concept of modernization of education defines the main tasks of vocational education - \"training a qualified employee of the appropriate level and profile, competitive in the labour market, competent, responsible, fluent in his profession and oriented in related fields of activity, capable of effective work in his specialty at the level of world standards, ready to constant professional growth, social and professional mobility\".</p><p>P a g e | <strong>57</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The solution of these problems is impossible without increasing the role of independent work of students on educational material, strengthening the responsibility of teachers for the development of independent work skills, for stimulating the professional growth of students, fostering creative activity and initiative.</p><p>Society imposes a fairly wide list of requirements on a modern specialist, among which the graduates have certain abilities and the ability to independently obtain knowledge from various sources, systematize the information received, and evaluate a specific financial situation. The formation of such a skill occurs throughout the entire period of study through the participation of students in practical classes, the performance of control tasks and tests, writing term papers and final qualifying works. At the same time, independent work of students plays a decisive role in the course of the entire educational process.</p><p>➢management of independent work of students includes:<br />➢clear planning of the content and volume of independent work;<br />➢organization, control and analysis of the results of independent work;<br />➢the necessary educational, methodological and logistical support; introduction of new learning technologies;<br />➢accounting for the labour costs of students and teachers in the framework of independent work of students.</p><p><strong>METHODOLOGY &amp; EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS</strong><br />The main characteristics of independent work of students:<br />1. Psychological conditions for the success of independent work of students. First of all, it is the formation of a sustainable interest in the chosen profession and methods of mastering its features, which depend on the following parameters:</p><p>•relationships between teachers and students in the educational process; •the level of complexity of tasks for independent work;<br />•involvement of students in the formed activity of the future profession.</p><p>Like any kind of human activity, educational activity from a psychological point of view is a process of solving specific problems. The difference between educational tasks and any others is that their goal is to change the subject himself, which consists in mastering certain modes of action, and not in changing the objects with which the subject acts. The need for setting and solving such problems arises before the subject only if he needs to master such methods of action, which are based on generalizations of a theoretical type.</p><p>Considering educational activity as a process of solving problems, the following links should be distinguished. First, the setting of the educational problem. In psychology (pedagogical psychology) it is known that the goal arises as a result of concretization of meaning-forming motives of activity. The function of such motives can be performed only by interest in the content of acquired knowledge. Without such interest, not only the independent setting of the educational task is impossible, but also the acceptance of the task set by the teacher.</p><p>Secondly, the use of optimal methods for solving the problem.</p><p>There is a fundamental difference between educational activity under the guidance of a teacher and its independent forms, which is not paid enough attention to. When a teacher leads students from a concept to reality, such a move has the force of only a methodical device. When it comes to the</p><p>P a g e | <strong>58</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>formation of a concept through independent work with educational materials and means, the conditions for activity change drastically:<br />The first among these conditions is the formation of methods for logical analysis of sources of educational information, in particular, methods for logical analysis of information models in which the content of scientific concepts is fixed, which at the same time is one of the most important tasks of education, designed to prepare students for independent learning activities. The second important condition for the transition to independent learning activity is the mastery of productive ways of solving educational problems, and ensuring this condition is almost impossible without the active methodological and methodological participation of the teacher.</p><p>Thirdly, the implementation of monitoring and evaluation of the progress and results of solving the problem. The formation of control and evaluation operations should go from mastering the methods of monitoring and evaluating the actions of a teacher and other students through monitoring and evaluating one's own work under the guidance of a teacher to self-control and self-evaluation of independent educational activities.</p><p>2. Professional orientation of disciplines. The indisputability of this educational and meaningful thesis in terms of knowledge, involvement in creative professional activities, effective personal interaction in the profession should not detract from the importance of knowledge of the general humanitarian culture of the relevant blocks of disciplines in the curriculum.</p><p>In addition, the depth of profiling of certain disciplines should take into account the psychological patterns of the multi-level division of future professionals: bachelors, specialists, masters.</p><p>3. Limited student time budget.</p><p>Firstly, when forming the time volume of his subject, the teacher must take into account the total</p><p>workload of students outside the often very subjective opinion of the undoubted importance of “my” discipline.</p><p>Secondly, the intensification of the educational process involves the rhythm of independent work of students by reducing the student's routine work in semesters.</p><p>4. Individualization of independent work of students, which includes:</p><p>• increase in the proportion of intensive work with more prepared students;</p><p>• division of the lesson into compulsory and creative parts (for everyone trying to cope with more difficult and, most importantly, non-standard tasks, additional questions, educational problem situations, etc.)</p><p>• regular consultations with trainees;</p><p>• comprehensive and timely information about the thematic content of independent work, deadlines, the need for auxiliary tools, forms, methods of monitoring and evaluating the final results with a mandatory comparison with the expected ones.</p><p><strong>RESULTS</strong><br />Forms of independent work of students are various. They include:<br />- study and systematization of official state documents - laws, decrees, decrees, normative - instructional and reference materials using information - retrieval systems, computer network \"Internet\";<br />- study of educational, scientific and methodical literature, materials of periodicals with the involvement of electronic means of official, statistical, periodical and scientific information;</p><p>P a g e | <strong>59</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\\\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>- preparation of reports and abstracts, writing term papers and final qualifying works;<br />- participation in the work of student conferences, complex scientific research. Independent work introduces students to scientific creativity, search and solution of topical modern problems. The leading goal of organizing and implementing independent work of students should coincide with the goal of student education - the preparation of a specialist and a bachelor with higher education. When organizing independent work of students, an important and necessary condition is the formation of the ability to work independently to acquire knowledge, skills and the possibility of organizing educational and scientific activities.</p><p>The purpose of independent work of students is to master fundamental knowledge, professional skills and skills of activity in the profile, experience in creative, research activities.</p><p>Independent work of students contributes to the development of independence, responsibility and organization, a creative approach to solving problems of the educational and professional level. The tasks of independent work of students are:</p><p>✓ systematization and consolidation of the received theoretical knowledge and practical skills of students;</p><p>✓ deepening and expanding theoretical knowledge; formation of skills to use normative, legal, reference documentation and special literature;</p><p>✓ development of cognitive abilities and activity of students: creative initiative, independence, responsibility and organization; formation of independent thinking, abilities for self-development, self-improvement and self-realization; development of research skills;</p><p>✓ the use of material collected and received during self-study at seminars, practical and laboratory classes, when writing term papers and theses, for effective preparation for final tests and exams.</p><p>The technological chain of independent work of students is as follows: a teacher in a certain discipline determines three-level goals of activity (reproductive, productive and creative) and specific forms of work, builds a system of motivation for students, provides them with educational and methodological materials, sets the deadlines for intermediate reports on the work done, organizes activities of creative groups, gives an introductory lecture, conducts consultations, monitors the results of self-control and self-correction of students, evaluates the results of their work (individual or group).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />A prerequisite for ensuring the effectiveness of independent work of students is the observance of stages in its organization and conduct. The following stages of independent work of students can be distinguished.</p><p>The first stage is preparatory. It should include the preparation of a work program with the allocation of topics and tasks for independent work of students; end-to-end planning of independent work of students for a semester; preparation of teaching materials; diagnostics of the level of preparedness of students.</p><p>The second stage is organizational. At this stage, the goals of individual and group work of students are determined; an introductory lecture is given, individual-group installation consultations are held, during which the forms of independent work of students and its control are explained; terms and forms of presentation of intermediate results are established.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>60</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The third stage is motivational and activity. The teacher at this stage should provide positive motivation for individual and group activities; verification of intermediate results; organization of self-control and self-correction; interchange and mutual verification in accordance with the chosen goal.</p><p>The fourth stage is control and evaluation. It includes individual and group reports and their evaluation. The results can be presented in the form of a graduation project, term paper, abstract, report, diagrams, tables, oral communications, models, layouts, reports, etc. (depending on discipline and specialty). Control of independent work of students can be carried out with the help of intermediate and final testing, writing in the classroom of written tests, colloquia, intermediate tests, etc. The process of introducing independent work of students into the educational process should be gradual and justified. For the effective implementation of this type of activity, the readiness of the teaching staff, a high-quality educational and methodological and appropriate regulatory framework are necessary.</p><p>The readiness of the teaching staff should be understood as the ability of the teacher to highlight the most important and feasible topics for the students' independent work of the discipline (course); to stimulate the internal mechanisms of self-development of the personality, self-control and self-correction. At the same time, such a teacher should have organizational, predictive and constructive skills.</p>"}]}

Linguistics will be highlighted as an integral part of the English language classroom. Library research often called a literature review is the methodology employed. It employs both descriptive and comparative methods of data collection. This finding suggests that linguistics recognizes its educational role. There is a strong connection between linguistics and language education. This is due to the correlation between language instruction and linguistic development. How can a language instructor train students in writing without a firm grasp of the fundamentals of language study (spelling, morphology, syntax, semantics, and lexicology)?

The area of linguistics examines how humans acquire and use language, how languages are similar and different, and what innate knowledge we have about language. Several dictionaries and encyclopedias (Chair, 2012; Langacker, 1973; Lyons, 1975; Martinet, 1989; Matthews, 1997; Pit Corder, 1973; Widdowson, 1985) agree that linguistics is the scientific study of language.</p><p>There have been three distinct phases in the evolution of language study: the speculative phase, the observation and classification phase, and the theory formulation phase (Chair 2003:332). Language study has a long and complex history of competing schools of thought and interpretations that can bewilder newcomers (Chair, 2003: 332).</p><p>There are numerous linguistics specializations. General and special linguistics are the two branches of linguistics that distinguish between studying language in the abstract and studying a specific language. Vocabulary study in a specific period or across periods can benefit from four different branches of linguistics: synchronic linguistics, descriptive linguistics, comparative historical linguistics, and contrastive linguistics. Soeparno (1995:17-18) distinguishes between micro and macro linguistics based on whether the focus is on the language's internal structure or things external to it.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>50</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The primary distinction between theoretical and applied linguistics is that the former emphasizes theorizing while the latter emphasizes applying what is learned. Several academic disciplines, including Dialectology, Sociolinguistics, Anthropology, Stylistics, and Philology, study language and its interactions with the world. Based on the approach and theory applied, language study can be further classified into traditional, structural, transformational, semantic, rational, and systemic linguistics.</p><p>It is inextricable from those above in the context of language education. If language instructor wants to help their students acquire the language, they must incorporate scientific methods into their lesson plans. They must be fluent in both the everyday language and a foreign language. Furthermore, linguistics is one of the sciences most closely associated with language instruction.</p><p>Multiple prior investigations have been conducted. Using language in scientific inquiry was the main emphasis of Franscy's (2015) and Aziz Thaba (2014) emphasized the significance of linguistics not just for language instructors but also for linguists and other language specialists. However, the importance of linguistics for educators is discussed here solely in the context of the English language classroom. The study's author will focus on the practical applications of linguistics for ESL educators.</p><p><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong><br />The Latin term \"lingua,\" which means \"language,\" is where our word \"linguistics\" originates. According to Kridalaksana's (1993) linguistic dictionary, \"linguistics\" refers to studying language from a scientific perspective. Tarigan (1986) proposed a similar concept, a body of information learned by applying the scientific method to language study. As the scientific study of language, linguistics makes no distinctions between different languages (Hasanan, 1984).</p><p>Language teaching and linguistics are two sides of the same coin. Both of these things are closely related to each other. Among those who study languages, there are divergent viewpoints. For Language Science to be a genuine scientific discipline, according to Parera (1991:20) and Suriasumantri (2009), it must be shielded from outside influences. Regarding linguistics, the object of study is the theory to which the language conforms, not its practical or communicative application. Language instruction is often regarded as the most important practical application of linguistics because experts in the field think that linguistics, Must also examine strategies to apply it in everyday life for the benefit of humanity.</p><p>Efforts made in the classroom that help children acquire a second language are successful. Because we recognize that a person's proficiency in a language is no assurance that he or she is someone who can teach that language to others, the linguistic theory is broken down so that a language teacher can learn how to apply these ideas to their teaching. Any classroom instruction in public speaking should lead to communicative activities that foster the development of genuine connections between students and teachers. We classified it as interpersonal interaction (Gusmuliana et al., 2020).</p><p>Teaching a foreign language follows a similar pragmatic and applied scientific approach. According to Basiran and Miftah (2010), the primary goal of language instruction is for students to become fluent in the target language as a means of communication.</p><p>To be fluent in a language is one thing, but having the linguistic expertise to break down and explain the language's phonemes, morphemes, words, sentences, and discourse structures is another ballgame. The language instructor would consider these divergent perspectives to paint a more complete picture for the students.

The concerns can be divided into three categories: content and method, outcomes, and process design. What a language is and how it is taught relies on the instructor's perspective and the curriculum's authors (Mackey, 1965, p. 139). In order to prepare pupils to speak effectively in a wide range of settings, linguistics plays a crucial role in language education.</p><p><strong>Methodology</strong><br />This investigation was a qualitative study, done primarily through research in libraries. Research in a library can take the form of reading books, taking notes, or reading reports on the findings of past studies (Sugiyono, 2016).

In addition, TESOL instructors should study linguistics and language education (LaFond & Dogancay-Aktuna, 2009). 4. The Importance of Language in the Classroom Changes in one's linguistic proficiency, anxiety levels, and sense of self are part of becoming an English language teacher (Giovanelli, 2015).

The study of individual linguistic units, from phonemes and morphemes to syntax and semantics, is known as microlinguistics.

Tools like error analysis can be used in linguistics to assist English teachers in examining this disparity. Error analysis is a branch of linguistics that examines student mistakes in greater depth. These areas are also related to language instruction, as Khansir (2013) stated. Language instructors have long used linguistics, with some favoring the more normative and prescriptive approach taken by traditional linguistics and others favoring the more structural and descriptive approach taken by modern linguistics. Teachers who consult a dusty grammar book to impart lessons in phonetics, syntax, and semantics are using linguistic expertise, more specifically, conventional linguistics. Phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics are only a few branches of linguistics that have practical applications in the classroom. A language's theoretical foundation is that it can be described linguistically, both its structure and its purpose.</p><p>Linguistics' impact on language instruction is indirect. As a result, linguistics and language education have developed into their distinct fields. Many different linguistic theories can be used in studying and instructing languages, but it does not imply that they do not rely on one another. Linguistics only provides resources indirectly.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />Instructing a class in English as a second language takes a lot of skill and expertise. An English teacher today needs to be well-versed in their pupils, their curriculum, a variety of teaching strategies, and the world at large. In addition, an English teacher needs to be highly motivated to succeed in his profession and to provide an excellent example for his students. Linguistics has various applications in the classroom. There are six ways that linguistics can be applied to the classroom (Roulet, 1975, pp. 65-75):<br />1. Language instructors can learn more about the overall structure and operation of the language system through linguistic theory. It is crucial in establishing language instruction's goals, materials, and methodology.</p><p>2. The philosophy of language also gives the instructor a common language to work. That is the universality of shapes, like the deletion and transformation formulas used in generative transformation grammar. Teachers of languages can make use of all of these resources.</p><p>3.

The quality of linguistic material taught in a foreign language can be enhanced by providing educators with a detailed description of the language being taught.</p><p>5.

Without a solid foundation in the methodology itself, any attempt to use a teaching technique to introduce new subject matter is doomed to fail.

Linguistics is more than just an academic discipline that studies language for its own sake; it also has an educational purpose. There is a strong connection between linguistics and language education. This is due to the correlation between language instruction and linguistic development. How can a language instructor train students in writing without a firm grasp of the fundamentals of language study (spelling, morphology, syntax, semantics, and lexicology)? As a language instructor, he needs to be fluent in the target language and have a firm grasp of its rules to convey those laws to his students effectively. Language teachers, according to Robert Lado, need to be familiar with the linguistic features and facts of their students' native languages in order to diagnose their students' difficulties with the target language.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br />1.Abidah, A.

The area of linguistics examines how humans acquire and use language, how languages are similar and different, and what innate knowledge we have about language. Several dictionaries and encyclopedias (Chair, 2012; Langacker, 1973; Lyons, 1975; Martinet, 1989; Matthews, 1997; Pit Corder, 1973; Widdowson, 1985) agree that linguistics is the scientific study of language.</p><p>There have been three distinct phases in the evolution of language study: the speculative phase, the observation and classification phase, and the theory formulation phase (Chair 2003:332). Language study has a long and complex history of competing schools of thought and interpretations that can bewilder newcomers (Chair, 2003: 332).</p><p>There are numerous linguistics specializations. General and special linguistics are the two branches of linguistics that distinguish between studying language in the abstract and studying a specific language. Vocabulary study in a specific period or across periods can benefit from four different branches of linguistics: synchronic linguistics, descriptive linguistics, comparative historical linguistics, and contrastive linguistics. Soeparno (1995:17-18) distinguishes between micro and macro linguistics based on whether the focus is on the language's internal structure or things external to it.</p><p>P a g e | <strong>50</strong> www.americanjournal.org</p><p>American Journal of Pedagogical and Educational Research Volume 15 August, 2023</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"media/image3.png\" style=\"width:7.11111in\" /></p><blockquote><p>The primary distinction between theoretical and applied linguistics is that the former emphasizes theorizing while the latter emphasizes applying what is learned. Several academic disciplines, including Dialectology, Sociolinguistics, Anthropology, Stylistics, and Philology, study language and its interactions with the world. Based on the approach and theory applied, language study can be further classified into traditional, structural, transformational, semantic, rational, and systemic linguistics.</p><p>It is inextricable from those above in the context of language education. If language instructor wants to help their students acquire the language, they must incorporate scientific methods into their lesson plans. They must be fluent in both the everyday language and a foreign language. Furthermore, linguistics is one of the sciences most closely associated with language instruction.</p><p>Multiple prior investigations have been conducted. Using language in scientific inquiry was the main emphasis of Franscy's (2015) and Aziz Thaba (2014) emphasized the significance of linguistics not just for language instructors but also for linguists and other language specialists. However, the importance of linguistics for educators is discussed here solely in the context of the English language classroom.

Factors that can cause the spread of tuberculosis, if treatment is not carried out quickly, will cause an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis. The aim of this research is to analyze the relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City. In this research, researchers used quantitative research as an approach. The research method used is an analytical survey while the type of research is Case Control. The total population was 35 tuberculosis cases with a sample size of 52 respondents who were divided between the case group and the control group using the Chi-Square test. The results of the study showed that there was a significant relationship between the independent variables of family smoking status (p-value = 0.018), ventilation area (p-value = 0.007) with the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>Tuberculosis, Family Smoking Status, Extent of Ventilation</p><blockquote><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and attacks the organs or tissues of the human body, especially the lungs. Every year, this disease can claim one million lives due to infection with tuberculosis. This has a huge impact on other people, especially the family or surrounding community (RI Ministry of Health, 2020).</p><p>Transmission of tuberculosis is caused by the spread of germs through the air in the form of phlegm droplets due to stones or sneezes from tuberculosis sufferers. In one cough or sneeze a sufferer can produce 300 splashes of phlegm. Germs that spread in the air are then inhaled by healthy people and enter the lungs, causing infections in healthy people. Pulmonary tuberculosis requires regular treatment for 6 months, if it is less than 6 months or incomplete then the treatment stage is repeated from the beginning and it will take a long time to recover from this disease and can even cause death.

Meanwhile, there were 17 respondents with non-smoking status, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 32.7%.</p><p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine the relationship between smoking status variables and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents with a family history of smoking status there were 22 respondents with a percentage of 84. 6%, and those with no family history of smoking status were 4 respondents with a percentage of 15.4%.

The respiratory epithelium is the main barrier against harmful environmental agents and protects by sweeping particles out in the mucus layer, phagocytizing and recruiting other immune cells. Smoking can directly</p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td><blockquote><p>compromise</p></blockquote></td><td>physical</td><td>barrier</td><td>integration,</td><td>increase</td><td>respiratory</td><td>epithelial</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>permeability and impair muccociliary clearance (Giacomo M, et al, 2011).</p><p>Smoking is an important factor that can reduce the body's immune system so that it can affect the recovery of treatment for tuberculosis sufferers. People who smoke are more at risk of suffering from tuberculosis because of the toxic content such as tar that is inhaled from cigarette smoke (Fitriani, 2014).</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 667</p><p>This smoking status consists of the smoking category and smoking habits. According to (Adin, 2016) The category of smokers is divided into passive smokers and active smokers. Passive and active smoking both have a bad impact on health. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous because cigarette smoke exhaled by active smokers and inhaled by passive smokers contains five times more carbon monoxide, four times more tar and nicotine.</p><p>Apart from that, bad smoking habits can also influence the smoking history in the family. According to (Suparyanto and Rosad, 2020), a person's smoking habit can be seen from the number of cigarettes smoked in one day and the length of time they consume cigarettes. The more cigarettes you smoke in one day, the more dangerous it will be for the body because the substances contained in cigarettes are cumulative (accumulated). And the longer someone consumes cigarettes, the more difficult it is to stop consuming cigarettes.</p><p>This research is in line with (Musdalifa, 2022) which suggests that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in productive age in South Sumatra Province with a p-value = 0.019 &lt; 0.05, this study explains that the large number of cigarettes consumed can be a factor in contracting tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with(Away, 2021)which suggests that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of pulmonary TB at the Sikumana Community Health Center, Kupang City with a p-value = 0.037 &lt; 0.05, in this study it is explained that someone with an active smoking status can be at risk of developing tuberculosis.</p><p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City with a value of OR = 5,500 which explains that smoking status in the family can be a factor in contracting tuberculosis because in this study, Researchers examined active and passive smokers in the family and surrounding environment. Smoking habits and the number of cigarettes consumed can also be a factor in the occurrence of tuberculosis.</p><p><strong>2.The Relationship between Ventilation Extent and the Incidence of Tuberculosis in</strong> <strong>the Banjarejo Community Health Center Working Area</strong><br />Based on the results of the univariate analysis that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the frequency distribution between ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City is dominated by respondents with ventilation area that does not meet the requirements, totaling 41 respondents, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 78. 8%. Meanwhile, there were 11 respondents with adequate ventilation area, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 21.2%.</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 668</p><p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine the relationship between the variable ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents whose ventilation area did not meet the requirements, there were 25 respondents with a percentage of 96 .2%, and respondents with adequate ventilation area were 1 respondent with a percentage of 3.8%. Meanwhile, in the control group, there were 16 respondents whose ventilation area did not meet the requirements, with a percentage of 61.5%, and there were 10 respondents whose ventilation area met the requirements, with a percentage of 38.5%. So based on the calculation results, the p-value = 0.007 (p &lt; 0.05) is obtained, which means that there is a relationship between the ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City.</p><p>Ventilation functions as a place for air exchange in a room to keep the air flow in the room fresh. According to (Ministry of Health, 2023) namely the ventilation area that covers 10% - 15% of the floor area. Therefore, a healthy home environment must receive sufficient sunlight and have adequate ventilation.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to (Saputri, 2022) which refers to the Health Service's 2007 Healthy Home Assessment Technical Guidelines so that the indoor air is fresh, the technical requirements for ventilation and windows are that ventilation holes remain at a minimum of 5% of the floor area and the incidental ventilation area (can be opened and closed) is a minimum of 5% of the floor area, The minimum window height is 80 cm from the floor, the air that enters is clean air, and the air flow is ensured not to be obstructed by household furniture.</p><p>This research is in line with (Khairani et al., 2020) which states that there is a relationship between the area of house ventilation and the incidence of pulmonary TB in adult patients visiting the Karang Jaya Community Health Center, North Muisi Rawas Regency with a p-value = 0.027 &lt; 0.05, in this study it states that poor ventilation area can be a factor contracted tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with (Sahadewa, 2019) which also explained that there was a relationship between ventilation and risk factors for the incidence of BTA pulmonary TB in Jatikalang Village, Krian District, Sidoarjo Regency with p-value = 0.006 &lt; 0.05, in this study it was stated that poor ventilation could be a factor in contracting tuberculosis.</p><p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City with an OR value = 15.625, which shows that respondents with poor ventilation area are at 15.625 greater risk of contracting tuberculosis compared to respondents with poor ventilation. has good ventilation area.</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 669</p><p>Poor ventilation in the respondent's house was caused by the narrow area of the house and the rooms being close to each other, making it impossible to provide ventilation in the room where they gathered. The respondent's home area is also a densely populated area so that the space between houses does not have a large enough area. Apart from that, poor ventilation can also be caused by ventilation that is not opened or cannot provide access for air in and out, only as a source of natural lighting.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />Based on the results of research on the relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the work area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, it can be concluded that the majority of respondents have a history of family smoking status and ventilation area that does not meet the requirements. This research shows that there is a relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the area. As a suggestion, for the Banjarejo Community Health Center, health workers are advised to provide education about the dangers of smoking, keeping the house clean, and the importance of opening and closing windows regularly. For Stikes Bhakti Husada Mulia Madiun, it is hoped that the results of this research will become study material for future researchers and become a reference regarding tuberculosis. For the public, it is recommended to pay attention to the physical condition of the house, especially ventilation, by regularly opening windows to let sunlight in, which will help reduce humidity and prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p><p><strong>REFERENCE</strong></p><p>Adin, V.

People who smoke are more at risk of suffering from tuberculosis because of the toxic content such as tar that is inhaled from cigarette smoke (Fitriani, 2014).</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 667</p><p>This smoking status consists of the smoking category and smoking habits. According to (Adin, 2016) The category of smokers is divided into passive smokers and active smokers. Passive and active smoking both have a bad impact on health. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous because cigarette smoke exhaled by active smokers and inhaled by passive smokers contains five times more carbon monoxide, four times more tar and nicotine.</p><p>Apart from that, bad smoking habits can also influence the smoking history in the family. According to (Suparyanto and Rosad, 2020), a person's smoking habit can be seen from the number of cigarettes smoked in one day and the length of time they consume cigarettes. The more cigarettes you smoke in one day, the more dangerous it will be for the body because the substances contained in cigarettes are cumulative (accumulated). And the longer someone consumes cigarettes, the more difficult it is to stop consuming cigarettes.</p><p>This research is in line with (Musdalifa, 2022) which suggests that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in productive age in South Sumatra Province with a p-value = 0.019 &lt; 0.05, this study explains that the large number of cigarettes consumed can be a factor in contracting tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with(Away, 2021)which suggests that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of pulmonary TB at the Sikumana Community Health Center, Kupang City with a p-value = 0.037 &lt; 0.05, in this study it is explained that someone with an active smoking status can be at risk of developing tuberculosis.</p><p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City with a value of OR = 5,500 which explains that smoking status in the family can be a factor in contracting tuberculosis because in this study, Researchers examined active and passive smokers in the family and surrounding environment. Smoking habits and the number of cigarettes consumed can also be a factor in the occurrence of tuberculosis.</p><p><strong>2.The Relationship between Ventilation Extent and the Incidence of Tuberculosis in</strong> <strong>the Banjarejo Community Health Center Working Area</strong><br />Based on the results of the univariate analysis that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the frequency distribution between ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City is dominated by respondents with ventilation area that does not meet the requirements, totaling 41 respondents, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 78. 8%. Meanwhile, there were 11 respondents with adequate ventilation area, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 21.2%.</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 668</p><p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine the relationship between the variable ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents whose ventilation area did not meet the requirements, there were 25 respondents with a percentage of 96 .2%, and respondents with adequate ventilation area were 1 respondent with a percentage of 3.8%. Meanwhile, in the control group, there were 16 respondents whose ventilation area did not meet the requirements, with a percentage of 61.5%, and there were 10 respondents whose ventilation area met the requirements, with a percentage of 38.5%. So based on the calculation results, the p-value = 0.007 (p &lt; 0.05) is obtained, which means that there is a relationship between the ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City.</p><p>Ventilation functions as a place for air exchange in a room to keep the air flow in the room fresh. According to (Ministry of Health, 2023) namely the ventilation area that covers 10% - 15% of the floor area. Therefore, a healthy home environment must receive sufficient sunlight and have adequate ventilation.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to (Saputri, 2022) which refers to the Health Service's 2007 Healthy Home Assessment Technical Guidelines so that the indoor air is fresh, the technical requirements for ventilation and windows are that ventilation holes remain at a minimum of 5% of the floor area and the incidental ventilation area (can be opened and closed) is a minimum of 5% of the floor area, The minimum window height is 80 cm from the floor, the air that enters is clean air, and the air flow is ensured not to be obstructed by household furniture.</p><p>This research is in line with (Khairani et al., 2020) which states that there is a relationship between the area of house ventilation and the incidence of pulmonary TB in adult patients visiting the Karang Jaya Community Health Center, North Muisi Rawas Regency with a p-value = 0.027 &lt; 0.05, in this study it states that poor ventilation area can be a factor contracted tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with (Sahadewa, 2019) which also explained that there was a relationship between ventilation and risk factors for the incidence of BTA pulmonary TB in Jatikalang Village, Krian District, Sidoarjo Regency with p-value = 0.006 &lt; 0.05, in this study it was stated that poor ventilation could be a factor in contracting tuberculosis.</p><p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City with an OR value = 15.625, which shows that respondents with poor ventilation area are at 15.625 greater risk of contracting tuberculosis compared to respondents with poor ventilation. has good ventilation area.</p><p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 669</p><p>Poor ventilation in the respondent's house was caused by the narrow area of the house and the rooms being close to each other, making it impossible to provide ventilation in the room where they gathered. The respondent's home area is also a densely populated area so that the space between houses does not have a large enough area. Apart from that, poor ventilation can also be caused by ventilation that is not opened or cannot provide access for air in and out, only as a source of natural lighting.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />Based on the results of research on the relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the work area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, it can be concluded that the majority of respondents have a history of family smoking status and ventilation area that does not meet the requirements. This research shows that there is a relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the area. As a suggestion, for the Banjarejo Community Health Center, health workers are advised to provide education about the dangers of smoking, keeping the house clean, and the importance of opening and closing windows regularly. For Stikes Bhakti Husada Mulia Madiun, it is hoped that the results of this research will become study material for future researchers and become a reference regarding tuberculosis. For the public, it is recommended to pay attention to the physical condition of the house, especially ventilation, by regularly opening windows to let sunlight in, which will help reduce humidity and prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p>"}]}

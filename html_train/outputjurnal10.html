    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Meat semi-finished products, depending on the method of preparation, are divided into peeled, dried and stuffed.
        During the cooking process, semi-finished products are subjected to such treatments as slicing, whipping in a
        frying pan, small slicing in a frying pan, whipping in a frying pan, seasoning and preparation for baking,
        pickling.</p>

        time, the porosity of the connective tissue in the meat increases, the surface of the meat is leveled, the top
        becomes smooth, as when ironing, giving the piece the appropriate shape. This creates the possibility of uniform
        thermal effects.</p>
    <p>Trim the spikes slightly. The thorns are cut in several places. This is done so that the portioned meat retains
        its shape during hot processing.</p>
    <p>In order to reduce the outflow of juice from meat and evaporation of moisture, it is rolled in flour. The product
        cooked in a frying pan forms a beautiful crust, which improves the taste of the product during hot processing.
        Before slicing, the meat is dipped in salmon. At the same time, urvak adheres well to the semi-finished product.

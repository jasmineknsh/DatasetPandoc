    <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br />
        Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and attacks the organs
        or tissues of the human body, especially the lungs, which is caused by an imbalance between the environment,
        agent and host. Factors that can cause the spread of tuberculosis, if treatment is not carried out quickly, will
        cause an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis. The aim of this research is to analyze the
        relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the
        working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City. In this research, researchers used
        quantitative research as an approach. The research method used is an analytical survey while the type of
        research is Case Control. The total population was 35 tuberculosis cases with a sample size of 52 respondents
        who were divided between the case group and the control group using the Chi-Square test. The results of the
        study showed that there was a significant relationship between the independent variables of family smoking
        status (p-value = 0.018), ventilation area (p-value = 0.007) with the incidence of tuberculosis in the working
        area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong>Tuberculosis, Family Smoking Status, Extent of Ventilation</p>
    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
        Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and attacks the organs
        or tissues of the human body, especially the lungs. Every year, this disease can claim one million lives due to
        infection with tuberculosis. This has a huge impact on other people, especially the family or surrounding
        community (RI Ministry of Health, 2020).</p>
    <p>Transmission of tuberculosis is caused by the spread of germs through the air in the form of phlegm droplets due
        to stones or sneezes from tuberculosis sufferers. In one cough or sneeze a sufferer can produce 300 splashes of
        phlegm. Germs that spread in the air are then inhaled by healthy people and enter the lungs, causing infections
        in healthy people. Pulmonary tuberculosis requires regular treatment for 6 months, if it is less than 6 months
        or incomplete then the treatment stage is repeated from the beginning and it will take a long time to recover
        from this disease and can even cause death. (RI Ministry of Health, 2020).</p>
    <p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 663</p>
    <p>In East Java, there were 42,560 cases of tuberculosis in 2021, 42,922 cases in 2020, and 78,799 cases in 2022.
        Because most tuberculosis patients are between 15 and 64 years old, community recovery and comprehensive
        treatment of the disease can be carried out. can increase their productivity and enable them to lead a normal
        life in society (East Java Provincial Health Service, 2022).</p>
    <p>Based on the 2021 Madiun City Health Profile, the Banjarejo Community Health Center work area has the highest
        number of tuberculosis cases, namely 26 cases in 2021, 22 cases in 2020, and 33 cases in 2019. Even though in
        2020 there was a decrease of 11 cases. with a percentage of 4.9% compared to the previous year, but in 2021
        there will be an additional 4 cases of tuberculosis or a percentage of 10% (Madiun City PP and Family Planning
        Health Service, 2022). Meanwhile, in 2023, based on medical record data at the Banjarejo Community Health
        Center, there will be 35 cases of tuberculosis.</p>
    <p>According to John Gordon's epidemiological triangle idea, an imbalance of host, agent, and environmental factors
        impacts the disease state. Likewise, pulmonary tuberculosis is caused by an imbalance between the environment,
        agent and host. Pulmonary tuberculosis host variables include the host, such as smoking status in the family.
    </p>
    <p>Environmental changes that facilitate the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis agents. This bacterium is a
        straight or slightly curved rod measuring 0.2 to 0.4 x 1.4 cm and can cause tuberculosis. These bacteria can
        survive for 20–30 hours in phlegm and 8–10 days in droplets.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, regarding environmental factors, one of the factors that causes tuberculosis is the condition of the
        home environment. Environmental factors in a house have an impact on the spread and transmission of
        Mycobacterium TB. People who live in damp, dark, and unventilated homes are more susceptible to the spread of
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Najiyah, 2022).</p>
    <p>Based on research (Musdalifa, 2022)which states that the smoking status factor has a close relationship with the
        incidence of tuberculosis with valuep value = 0.019. According to researchers, there is a relationship between
        smoking status and education, where someone with low education tends to smoke and increases the risk of
        developing pulmonary TB.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, regarding environmental factors, one of the factors that causes tuberculosis is the condition of the
        home environment. Environmental factors in a house have an impact on the spread and transmission of
        Mycobacterium TB. People who live in damp, dark, and unventilated homes are more susceptible to the spread of
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on research results(Rosyid, 2023)in 2022, which is located in the working area
        of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, the condition of the physical environment of the house
        which is one of the causes of the spread of tuberculosis in the Banjarejo Community Health Center area is the
        ventilation area that does not meet the requirements with a percentage of 53.%.</p>
    <p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 664</p>
    <p>Based on the description above, this is the background for conducting research on "The relationship between
        family smoking status and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
        Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City.</p>

        <strong>1.The Relationship between Family Smoking Status and the Incidence of</strong> <strong>Tuberculosis in
            the Working Area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center,</strong> <strong>Madiun City</strong><br />
        Based on the results of the univariate analysis that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the
        frequency distribution between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
        Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City is dominated by respondents with smoking status, totaling 35
        respondents, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 67.3%. Meanwhile, there were 17 respondents with
        non-smoking status, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 32.7%.
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine the
        relationship between smoking status variables and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
        Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents with a family
        history of smoking status there were 22 respondents with a percentage of 84. 6%, and those with no family
        history of smoking status were 4 respondents with a percentage of 15.4%. Meanwhile, in the control group with
        family smoking status there were 13 respondents with a percentage of 50% and there were 13 respondents with
        non-smoking status with a percentage of 50%.</p>
    <p>So, based on the calculation results, the p-value = 0.018 (p &lt; 0.05) is obtained, which means that there is a
        relationship between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo
        Health Center, Madiun City.</p>
    <p>According to Giacomo's theory, smoking is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and is often the

    <p>permeability and impair muccociliary clearance (Giacomo M, et al, 2011).</p>
    <p>Smoking is an important factor that can reduce the body's immune system so that it can affect the recovery of
        treatment for tuberculosis sufferers. People who smoke are more at risk of suffering from tuberculosis because
        of the toxic content such as tar that is inhaled from cigarette smoke (Fitriani, 2014).</p>
    <p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 667</p>
    <p>This smoking status consists of the smoking category and smoking habits. According to (Adin, 2016) The category
        of smokers is divided into passive smokers and active smokers. Passive and active smoking both have a bad impact
        on health. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous because cigarette smoke exhaled by active smokers and inhaled by
        passive smokers contains five times more carbon monoxide, four times more tar and nicotine.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, bad smoking habits can also influence the smoking history in the family. According to
        (Suparyanto and Rosad, 2020), a person's smoking habit can be seen from the number of cigarettes smoked in one
        day and the length of time they consume cigarettes. The more cigarettes you smoke in one day, the more dangerous
        it will be for the body because the substances contained in cigarettes are cumulative (accumulated). And the
        longer someone consumes cigarettes, the more difficult it is to stop consuming cigarettes.</p>
    <p>This research is in line with (Musdalifa, 2022) which suggests that there is a relationship between smoking
        status and the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in productive age in South Sumatra Province with a p-value =
        0.019 &lt; 0.05, this study explains that the large number of cigarettes consumed can be a factor in contracting
        tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with(Away, 2021)which suggests that there is a
        relationship between smoking status and the incidence of pulmonary TB at the Sikumana Community Health Center,
        Kupang City with a p-value = 0.037 &lt; 0.05, in this study it is explained that someone with an active smoking
        status can be at risk of developing tuberculosis.</p>
    <p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between
        smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center,
        Madiun City with a value of OR = 5,500 which explains that smoking status in the family can be a factor in
        contracting tuberculosis because in this study, Researchers examined active and passive smokers in the family
        and surrounding environment. Smoking habits and the number of cigarettes consumed can also be a factor in the
        occurrence of tuberculosis.</p>
    <p><strong>2.The Relationship between Ventilation Extent and the Incidence of Tuberculosis in</strong> <strong>the
            Banjarejo Community Health Center Working Area</strong><br />
        Based on the results of the univariate analysis that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the
        frequency distribution between ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
        Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City is dominated by respondents with ventilation area that does not
        meet the requirements, totaling 41 respondents, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 78. 8%. Meanwhile,
        there were 11 respondents with adequate ventilation area, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 21.2%.
    </p>
    <p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 668</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine the
        relationship between the variable ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
        Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents whose
        ventilation area did not meet the requirements, there were 25 respondents with a percentage of 96 .2%, and
        respondents with adequate ventilation area were 1 respondent with a percentage of 3.8%. Meanwhile, in the
        control group, there were 16 respondents whose ventilation area did not meet the requirements, with a percentage
        of 61.5%, and there were 10 respondents whose ventilation area met the requirements, with a percentage of 38.5%.
        So based on the calculation results, the p-value = 0.007 (p &lt; 0.05) is obtained, which means that there is a
        relationship between the ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo
        Health Center, Madiun City.</p>
    <p>Ventilation functions as a place for air exchange in a room to keep the air flow in the room fresh. According to
        (Ministry of Health, 2023) namely the ventilation area that covers 10% - 15% of the floor area. Therefore, a
        healthy home environment must receive sufficient sunlight and have adequate ventilation.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, according to (Saputri, 2022) which refers to the Health Service's 2007 Healthy Home Assessment
        Technical Guidelines so that the indoor air is fresh, the technical requirements for ventilation and windows are
        that ventilation holes remain at a minimum of 5% of the floor area and the incidental ventilation area (can be
        opened and closed) is a minimum of 5% of the floor area, The minimum window height is 80 cm from the floor, the
        air that enters is clean air, and the air flow is ensured not to be obstructed by household furniture.</p>
    <p>This research is in line with (Khairani et al., 2020) which states that there is a relationship between the area
        of house ventilation and the incidence of pulmonary TB in adult patients visiting the Karang Jaya Community
        Health Center, North Muisi Rawas Regency with a p-value = 0.027 &lt; 0.05, in this study it states that poor
        ventilation area can be a factor contracted tuberculosis. The results of this study are also in line with
        (Sahadewa, 2019) which also explained that there was a relationship between ventilation and risk factors for the
        incidence of BTA pulmonary TB in Jatikalang Village, Krian District, Sidoarjo Regency with p-value = 0.006 &lt;
        0.05, in this study it was stated that poor ventilation could be a factor in contracting tuberculosis.</p>
    <p>Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, it is stated that there is a relationship between
        ventilation area and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun
        City with an OR value = 15.625, which shows that respondents with poor ventilation area are at 15.625 greater
        risk of contracting tuberculosis compared to respondents with poor ventilation. has good ventilation area.</p>
    <p>Volume 5, No. 9 September, 2024 669</p>
    <p>Poor ventilation in the respondent's house was caused by the narrow area of the house and the rooms being close
        to each other, making it impossible to provide ventilation in the room where they gathered. The respondent's
        home area is also a densely populated area so that the space between houses does not have a large enough area.
        Apart from that, poor ventilation can also be caused by ventilation that is not opened or cannot provide access
        for air in and out, only as a source of natural lighting.</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />
        Based on the results of research on the relationship between family smoking status and ventilation area with the
        incidence of tuberculosis in the work area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City, it can be
        concluded that the majority of respondents have a history of family smoking status and ventilation area that
        does not meet the requirements. This research shows that there is a relationship between family smoking status
        and ventilation area with the incidence of tuberculosis in the area. As a suggestion, for the Banjarejo
        Community Health Center, health workers are advised to provide education about the dangers of smoking, keeping
        the house clean, and the importance of opening and closing windows regularly. For Stikes Bhakti Husada Mulia
        Madiun, it is hoped that the results of this research will become study material for future researchers and
        become a reference regarding tuberculosis. For the public, it is recommended to pay attention to the physical
        condition of the house, especially ventilation, by regularly opening windows to let sunlight in, which will help
        reduce humidity and prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p>

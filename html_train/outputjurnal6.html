    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Independent work - planned educational, educational research, research work of students, performed outside the
        classroom (classroom) time on assignment and with the methodological guidance of the teacher, but without his
        direct participation (with partial direct participation of the teacher, leaving the leading role for the work of
        students). Independent work of students in the university is an important type of educational and scientific
        activity of the student.</p>
    <p>Independent work of students plays a significant role in the rating technology of education. The state standard
        provides, as a rule, 50% of the hours of the total labour intensity of the discipline for independent work of
        students. In this regard, education at a university includes two parts that are almost identical in volume and
        mutual influence - the learning process and the self-learning process. Therefore, the independent work of
        students should become an effective and purposeful work of the student.</p>
    <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong><br />
        The concept of modernization of education defines the main tasks of vocational education - "training a qualified
        employee of the appropriate level and profile, competitive in the labour market, competent, responsible, fluent
        in his profession and oriented in related fields of activity, capable of effective work in his specialty at the
        level of world standards, ready to constant professional growth, social and professional mobility".</p>

    <p>The solution of these problems is impossible without increasing the role of independent work of students on
        educational material, strengthening the responsibility of teachers for the development of independent work
        skills, for stimulating the professional growth of students, fostering creative activity and initiative.</p>
    <p>Society imposes a fairly wide list of requirements on a modern specialist, among which the graduates have certain
        abilities and the ability to independently obtain knowledge from various sources, systematize the information
        received, and evaluate a specific financial situation. The formation of such a skill occurs throughout the
        entire period of study through the participation of students in practical classes, the performance of control
        tasks and tests, writing term papers and final qualifying works. At the same time, independent work of students
        plays a decisive role in the course of the entire educational process.</p>
    <p>➢management of independent work of students includes:<br />
        ➢clear planning of the content and volume of independent work;<br />
        ➢organization, control and analysis of the results of independent work;<br />
        ➢the necessary educational, methodological and logistical support; introduction of new learning
        technologies;<br />
        ➢accounting for the labour costs of students and teachers in the framework of independent work of students.</p>
    <p><strong>METHODOLOGY &amp; EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS</strong><br />
        The main characteristics of independent work of students:<br />
        1. Psychological conditions for the success of independent work of students. First of all, it is the formation
        of a sustainable interest in the chosen profession and methods of mastering its features, which depend on the
        following parameters:</p>
    <p>•relationships between teachers and students in the educational process; •the level of complexity of tasks for
        independent work;<br />
        •involvement of students in the formed activity of the future profession.</p>
    <p>Like any kind of human activity, educational activity from a psychological point of view is a process of solving
        specific problems. The difference between educational tasks and any others is that their goal is to change the
        subject himself, which consists in mastering certain modes of action, and not in changing the objects with which
        the subject acts. The need for setting and solving such problems arises before the subject only if he needs to
        master such methods of action, which are based on generalizations of a theoretical type.</p>
    <p>Considering educational activity as a process of solving problems, the following links should be distinguished.
        First, the setting of the educational problem. In psychology (pedagogical psychology) it is known that the goal
        arises as a result of concretization of meaning-forming motives of activity. The function of such motives can be
        performed only by interest in the content of acquired knowledge. Without such interest, not only the independent
        setting of the educational task is impossible, but also the acceptance of the task set by the teacher.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the use of optimal methods for solving the problem.</p>
    <p>There is a fundamental difference between educational activity under the guidance of a teacher and its
        independent forms, which is not paid enough attention to. When a teacher leads students from a concept to
        reality, such a move has the force of only a methodical device. When it comes to the</p>

    <p>formation of a concept through independent work with educational materials and means, the conditions for activity
        change drastically:<br />
        The first among these conditions is the formation of methods for logical analysis of sources of educational
        information, in particular, methods for logical analysis of information models in which the content of
        scientific concepts is fixed, which at the same time is one of the most important tasks of education, designed
        to prepare students for independent learning activities. The second important condition for the transition to
        independent learning activity is the mastery of productive ways of solving educational problems, and ensuring
        this condition is almost impossible without the active methodological and methodological participation of the
        teacher.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, the implementation of monitoring and evaluation of the progress and results of solving the problem. The
        formation of control and evaluation operations should go from mastering the methods of monitoring and evaluating
        the actions of a teacher and other students through monitoring and evaluating one's own work under the guidance
        of a teacher to self-control and self-evaluation of independent educational activities.</p>
    <p>2. Professional orientation of disciplines. The indisputability of this educational and meaningful thesis in
        terms of knowledge, involvement in creative professional activities, effective personal interaction in the
        profession should not detract from the importance of knowledge of the general humanitarian culture of the
        relevant blocks of disciplines in the curriculum.</p>
    <p>In addition, the depth of profiling of certain disciplines should take into account the psychological patterns of
        the multi-level division of future professionals: bachelors, specialists, masters.</p>
    <p>3. Limited student time budget.</p>
    <p>Firstly, when forming the time volume of his subject, the teacher must take into account the total</p>
    <p>workload of students outside the often very subjective opinion of the undoubted importance of “my” discipline.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, the intensification of the educational process involves the rhythm of independent work of students by
        reducing the student's routine work in semesters.</p>
    <p>4. Individualization of independent work of students, which includes:</p>
    <p>• increase in the proportion of intensive work with more prepared students;</p>
    <p>• division of the lesson into compulsory and creative parts (for everyone trying to cope with more difficult and,
        most importantly, non-standard tasks, additional questions, educational problem situations, etc.)</p>
    <p>• regular consultations with trainees;</p>
    <p>• comprehensive and timely information about the thematic content of independent work, deadlines, the need for
        auxiliary tools, forms, methods of monitoring and evaluating the final results with a mandatory comparison with
        the expected ones.</p>
    <p><strong>RESULTS</strong><br />
        Forms of independent work of students are various. They include:<br />
        - study and systematization of official state documents - laws, decrees, decrees, normative - instructional and
        reference materials using information - retrieval systems, computer network "Internet";<br />
        - study of educational, scientific and methodical literature, materials of periodicals with the involvement of
        electronic means of official, statistical, periodical and scientific information;</p>

    <p>- preparation of reports and abstracts, writing term papers and final qualifying works;<br />
        - participation in the work of student conferences, complex scientific research. Independent work introduces
        students to scientific creativity, search and solution of topical modern problems. The leading goal of
        organizing and implementing independent work of students should coincide with the goal of student education -
        the preparation of a specialist and a bachelor with higher education. When organizing independent work of
        students, an important and necessary condition is the formation of the ability to work independently to acquire
        knowledge, skills and the possibility of organizing educational and scientific activities.</p>
    <p>The purpose of independent work of students is to master fundamental knowledge, professional skills and skills of
        activity in the profile, experience in creative, research activities.</p>
    <p>Independent work of students contributes to the development of independence, responsibility and organization, a
        creative approach to solving problems of the educational and professional level. The tasks of independent work
        of students are:</p>
    <p>✓ systematization and consolidation of the received theoretical knowledge and practical skills of students;</p>
    <p>✓ deepening and expanding theoretical knowledge; formation of skills to use normative, legal, reference
        documentation and special literature;</p>
    <p>✓ development of cognitive abilities and activity of students: creative initiative, independence, responsibility
        and organization; formation of independent thinking, abilities for self-development, self-improvement and
        self-realization; development of research skills;</p>
    <p>✓ the use of material collected and received during self-study at seminars, practical and laboratory classes,
        when writing term papers and theses, for effective preparation for final tests and exams.</p>
    <p>The technological chain of independent work of students is as follows: a teacher in a certain discipline
        determines three-level goals of activity (reproductive, productive and creative) and specific forms of work,
        builds a system of motivation for students, provides them with educational and methodological materials, sets
        the deadlines for intermediate reports on the work done, organizes activities of creative groups, gives an
        introductory lecture, conducts consultations, monitors the results of self-control and self-correction of
        students, evaluates the results of their work (individual or group).</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />
        A prerequisite for ensuring the effectiveness of independent work of students is the observance of stages in its
        organization and conduct. The following stages of independent work of students can be distinguished.</p>
    <p>The first stage is preparatory. It should include the preparation of a work program with the allocation of topics
        and tasks for independent work of students; end-to-end planning of independent work of students for a semester;
        preparation of teaching materials; diagnostics of the level of preparedness of students.</p>
    <p>The second stage is organizational. At this stage, the goals of individual and group work of students are
        determined; an introductory lecture is given, individual-group installation consultations are held, during which
        the forms of independent work of students and its control are explained; terms and forms of presentation of
        intermediate results are established.</p>

    <p>The third stage is motivational and activity. The teacher at this stage should provide positive motivation for
        individual and group activities; verification of intermediate results; organization of self-control and
        self-correction; interchange and mutual verification in accordance with the chosen goal.</p>
    <p>The fourth stage is control and evaluation. It includes individual and group reports and their evaluation. The
        results can be presented in the form of a graduation project, term paper, abstract, report, diagrams, tables,
        oral communications, models, layouts, reports, etc. (depending on discipline and specialty). Control of
        independent work of students can be carried out with the help of intermediate and final testing, writing in the
        classroom of written tests, colloquia, intermediate tests, etc. The process of introducing independent work of
        students into the educational process should be gradual and justified. For the effective implementation of this
        type of activity, the readiness of the teaching staff, a high-quality educational and methodological and
        appropriate regulatory framework are necessary.</p>
    <p>The readiness of the teaching staff should be understood as the ability of the teacher to highlight the most
        important and feasible topics for the students' independent work of the discipline (course); to stimulate the
        internal mechanisms of self-development of the personality, self-control and self-correction. At the same time,
        such a teacher should have organizational, predictive and constructive skills.</p>

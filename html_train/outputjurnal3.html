    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Perception is the most important of the functions of the higher nervous activity of man. With the birth of a
        person, he begins to perceive information both from the outside and from within himself, in order to instantly
        process it, and subsequently comprehend it. Thus, perception includes in the work the next, no less important
        function of a person - thinking. Comprehension of the information received with the help of sensors creates the
        phenomenon called life: it encourages a person to act, helps to accumulate experience and transmit this
        experience to others through speech.</p>
    <p>Among the names of the area of perception, cognitive and speech spheres, the central place undoubtedly belongs to
        verbs - designations of the processes of perception, thinking, speaking. Thus, we emphasize that the main goal
        of our analysis is related to the study of verbs and the procedural component expressed by them, while we leave
        aside the subsystems of nouns and adjectives. Thus, in the chain brain - brain - braining - brain, we are only
        interested in braining. At a later stage, from the instrument of thinking (the brain), the nominations of the
        process are formed, motivated by the instrument of action. But to some extent, these subsystems can also become
        the object of our attention. Verbs of perception, thinking and speaking in the Old Russian language represent a
        system in which three semantic groups are interconnected. The core of this system is symmetrical-asymmetrical
        manifestations at the level of lexical-semantic groups of verbs of perception, thinking, and speaking.
        System-wide regularities are quite fully manifested in the system of verbs of perception, thinking, and
        speaking.</p>
    <p>Systemic transformations in the Old Russian language on the example of the studied groups of vocabulary reveal
        quantitative, qualitative and relative transformations that occur against the background of identical
        transformation.</p>
    <p>The structural-semantic classification of verbs shows the greatest systemic completeness in the octet, which
        guarantees the accuracy, completeness and consistency of the theoretical representation of the linguistic
        material.</p>
    <p>In the semantic structure of verbs, there is a development of a transition from a concrete material meaning to a
        more abstract one: for example, the Balto-Slavic character has the lexeme *<em><strong>itъ</strong></em> \
        Baltic</p>

    <p>correspondences of this word mean "reason, habits" and are associated with the verb umЪti. Also, the Balto-Slavic
        character has the root *<em><strong>ik-</strong></em> (connected by alternation with
        <em><strong>*uuk-</strong></em> , cf. to get used to), from</p>
    <p>which the verb uchiti is derived, where, as in umЪti, the transition from abstract meaning to concrete is made.
    </p>
    <p>Verbs of perception, which include about 50 lexemes, denote both generalized perception in the form of sensations
        (chuti) and concrete visual and auditory perception (sizirati, rasmatrshti and v'nouishti, listen), while the
        meaning of perception is diffuse, approaching in its semantics the designations of mental processes - "to know",
        "to heed", "to think", "to foresee". It is also noteworthy that all 6 lexemes noted in the work with the general
        semantics of perception, thinking and speaking belong to the lexical-semantic group of verbs of perception.
        These are the verbs въноушати, вънлтиА, просе</p>
    <p>Ътити, поslushti, съматршти, съмотрЪти. Thus, the thesis about the primacy of perception in the development of
        thinking and speaking processes is confirmed.</p>
    <p>Semantic analysis of verbs of perception, thinking and speaking has shown the presence of close relationships
        between the three lexical groups of verbs. These connections have an explicit character in the definitions,
        revealed on our material in 6 lexemes: for example, slushati means "to hear" (perception), "to listen, to pay
        attention" (thinking), "to testify" (speaking); so can be represented in morphemic composition: for example, the
        root sorphema -вЪд- forms the verb вЪдатъ "to know" (cf. бел ведацъ "to know"), it is connected by the
        alternation of vowels with the verb vidЪti with a simple</p>
    <p>semantic move: "to see" means "to learn"; the same root in the lexemes вЪшати, вЪстити, denotes speaking, i.e.
        semantics develops from perception ("to see") to thinking ("to know") and speaking ("to say").</p>
    <p>The study of the range of designations of the processes of perception, thinking and speaking in the Old Russian
        language, the description of their lexical components according to the selected classification parameters and
        the factors of relationships showed that the studied semantic sphere in the language is structured: in the
        linguistic picture of the world of Ancient Russia, ideas about the processes of perception, thinking and
        speaking are ordered in a special way - they form a system. The Old Russian verbs of perception, thinking, and
        speaking represent a fully coherent system on the basis of the general theory of systems of the biologist and
        philosopher acad. Y. A. Urmantseva and its Applications to the Language of V. A. Karpov. Thanks to the use of
        the logical-mathematical model of representation of knowledge in the form of a two- and three-dimensional Gray
        code in the analysis of linguistic facts, the rigor and accuracy of linguistic description at any level of
        language have been achieved.</p>
    <p>Thus, it should be noted that a linguistic group of transformations that create verbs of the lexical-semantic
        groups under study has been derived: these are quantitative, qualitative and relative transformations and their
        combinatorics.</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        The field of linguistics is the scientific study of language, and its scope refers to the range of issues
        studied by linguists. The area of linguistics examines how humans acquire and use language, how languages are
        similar and different, and what innate knowledge we have about language. Several dictionaries and encyclopedias
        (Chair, 2012; Langacker, 1973; Lyons, 1975; Martinet, 1989; Matthews, 1997; Pit Corder, 1973; Widdowson, 1985)
        agree that linguistics is the scientific study of language.</p>
    <p>There have been three distinct phases in the evolution of language study: the speculative phase, the observation
        and classification phase, and the theory formulation phase (Chair 2003:332). Language study has a long and
        complex history of competing schools of thought and interpretations that can bewilder newcomers (Chair, 2003:
        332).</p>
    <p>There are numerous linguistics specializations. General and special linguistics are the two branches of
        linguistics that distinguish between studying language in the abstract and studying a specific language.
        Vocabulary study in a specific period or across periods can benefit from four different branches of linguistics:
        synchronic linguistics, descriptive linguistics, comparative historical linguistics, and contrastive
        linguistics. Soeparno (1995:17-18) distinguishes between micro and macro linguistics based on whether the focus
        is on the language's internal structure or things external to it.</p>

    <p>The primary distinction between theoretical and applied linguistics is that the former emphasizes theorizing
        while the latter emphasizes applying what is learned. Several academic disciplines, including Dialectology,
        Sociolinguistics, Anthropology, Stylistics, and Philology, study language and its interactions with the world.
        Based on the approach and theory applied, language study can be further classified into traditional, structural,
        transformational, semantic, rational, and systemic linguistics.</p>
    <p>It is inextricable from those above in the context of language education. If language instructor wants to help
        their students acquire the language, they must incorporate scientific methods into their lesson plans. They must
        be fluent in both the everyday language and a foreign language. Furthermore, linguistics is one of the sciences
        most closely associated with language instruction.</p>
    <p>Multiple prior investigations have been conducted. Using language in scientific inquiry was the main emphasis of
        Franscy's (2015) and Aziz Thaba (2014) emphasized the significance of linguistics not just for language
        instructors but also for linguists and other language specialists. However, the importance of linguistics for
        educators is discussed here solely in the context of the English language classroom. The study's author will
        focus on the practical applications of linguistics for ESL educators.</p>
    <p><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong><br />
        The Latin term "lingua," which means "language," is where our word "linguistics" originates. According to
        Kridalaksana's (1993) linguistic dictionary, "linguistics" refers to studying language from a scientific
        perspective. Tarigan (1986) proposed a similar concept, a body of information learned by applying the scientific
        method to language study. As the scientific study of language, linguistics makes no distinctions between
        different languages (Hasanan, 1984).</p>
    <p>Language teaching and linguistics are two sides of the same coin. Both of these things are closely related to
        each other. Among those who study languages, there are divergent viewpoints. For Language Science to be a
        genuine scientific discipline, according to Parera (1991:20) and Suriasumantri (2009), it must be shielded from
        outside influences. Regarding linguistics, the object of study is the theory to which the language conforms, not
        its practical or communicative application. Language instruction is often regarded as the most important
        practical application of linguistics because experts in the field think that linguistics, Must also examine
        strategies to apply it in everyday life for the benefit of humanity.</p>
    <p>Efforts made in the classroom that help children acquire a second language are successful. Because we recognize
        that a person's proficiency in a language is no assurance that he or she is someone who can teach that language
        to others, the linguistic theory is broken down so that a language teacher can learn how to apply these ideas to
        their teaching. Any classroom instruction in public speaking should lead to communicative activities that foster
        the development of genuine connections between students and teachers. We classified it as interpersonal
        interaction (Gusmuliana et al., 2020).</p>
    <p>Teaching a foreign language follows a similar pragmatic and applied scientific approach. According to Basiran and
        Miftah (2010), the primary goal of language instruction is for students to become fluent in the target language
        as a means of communication.</p>
    <p>To be fluent in a language is one thing, but having the linguistic expertise to break down and explain the
        language's phonemes, morphemes, words, sentences, and discourse structures is another ballgame. The language
        instructor would consider these divergent perspectives to paint a more complete picture for the students. What
        to teach and how to teach it are two of the biggest challenges in language</p>

    <p>education. The concerns can be divided into three categories: content and method, outcomes, and process design.
        What a language is and how it is taught relies on the instructor's perspective and the curriculum's authors
        (Mackey, 1965, p. 139). In order to prepare pupils to speak effectively in a wide range of settings, linguistics
        plays a crucial role in language education.</p>
    <p><strong>Methodology</strong><br />
        This investigation was a qualitative study, done primarily through research in libraries. Research in a library
        can take the form of reading books, taking notes, or reading reports on the findings of past studies (Sugiyono,
        2016). In this example, the researcher followed a systematic procedure to compile data from various sources
        pertinent to the variables under investigation, including linguists, language instructors, and language
        education. There are six journals or publications on linguistics and seven on the teaching of languages.</p>
    <p>The researcher then attempted to make sense of the data and apply it to a guiding hypothesis. Relevant literature
        was consulted for this analysis. There are two main categories of approaches to data analysis: A. The
        descriptive method is used to describe and make sense of what already exists, how opinions are changing, what
        processes are happening, and what results or trends are emerging.</p>
    <p>B. The theories and expert opinions were compared using a comparative methodology. (Sumanto, 2014)</p>

        Language and instruction were topics of discussion in a few of the essays. References: 1. Khan, S. (2011). "The
        Role of Applied Linguistics in English Language Teaching in Saudi Arabia," International Journal of English

        language education (LaFond &amp; Dogancay-Aktuna, 2009). 4. The Importance of Language in the Classroom Changes
        in one's linguistic proficiency, anxiety levels, and sense of self are part of becoming an English language
        teacher (Giovanelli, 2015). Banegas (2020) investigated the most effective methods of teaching linguistics to
        future educators with a low English command by conducting an action research study. Oda, Y. (2020) Positioning
        English Language Teaching (ELT) in Applied Linguistics in Japan: A Diachronic Approach will appear in the sixth
        volume of Asian Englishes.</p>
    <p>Based on the research team's readings, Lafond (2009) argues that linguistics is essential in ESL classrooms
        because it helps instructors break down the building blocks of the English language for their pupils. The study
        of individual linguistic units, from phonemes and morphemes to syntax and semantics, is known as
        microlinguistics. However, other fields (macro linguistics) like psychology, education, cognitive science,
        music, anthropology, ethnology, language acquisition, sociology, bilingualism, and language instruction should
        be incorporated into studying English as a foreign language.</p>
    <p>Applied linguistics is the term typically used to refer to the study of language and its function in formal and
        informal educational settings. This field encompasses research in phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax,
        semantics, and other titles such as psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics that focus on language acquisition
        and situation theory. Linguistic subfields such as theoretical linguistics,</p>

    <p>sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics all provide essential contributions to the field of language instruction
        and should not be seen in isolation.</p>
    <p>Khan Intakhab Alam (2011) noted that in the present day, English teachers also use comparative studies. Tools
        like error analysis can be used in linguistics to assist English teachers in examining this disparity. Error
        analysis is a branch of linguistics that examines student mistakes in greater depth. These areas are also
        related to language instruction, as Khansir (2013) stated. Language instructors have long used linguistics, with
        some favoring the more normative and prescriptive approach taken by traditional linguistics and others favoring
        the more structural and descriptive approach taken by modern linguistics. Teachers who consult a dusty grammar
        book to impart lessons in phonetics, syntax, and semantics are using linguistic expertise, more specifically,
        conventional linguistics. Phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics are only a few branches of
        linguistics that have practical applications in the classroom. A language's theoretical foundation is that it
        can be described linguistically, both its structure and its purpose.</p>
    <p>Linguistics' impact on language instruction is indirect. As a result, linguistics and language education have
        developed into their distinct fields. Many different linguistic theories can be used in studying and instructing
        languages, but it does not imply that they do not rely on one another. Linguistics only provides resources
        indirectly.</p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />
        Instructing a class in English as a second language takes a lot of skill and expertise. An English teacher today
        needs to be well-versed in their pupils, their curriculum, a variety of teaching strategies, and the world at
        large. In addition, an English teacher needs to be highly motivated to succeed in his profession and to provide
        an excellent example for his students. Linguistics has various applications in the classroom. There are six ways
        that linguistics can be applied to the classroom (Roulet, 1975, pp. 65-75):<br />
        1. Language instructors can learn more about the overall structure and operation of the language system through
        linguistic theory. It is crucial in establishing language instruction's goals, materials, and methodology.</p>
    <p>2. The philosophy of language also gives the instructor a common language to work. That is the universality of
        shapes, like the deletion and transformation formulas used in generative transformation grammar. Teachers of
        languages can make use of all of these resources.</p>
    <p>3. The linguistic theory of language acquisition impacts language education, particularly the methods used to
        instruct students.</p>
    <p>4. The quality of linguistic material taught in a foreign language can be enhanced by providing educators with a
        detailed description of the language being taught.</p>
    <p>5. Through linguistic description, The teacher gains insight into linguistic building blocks such as phonemes,
        morphemes, and tagmemes. Moreover, it also gives a system of formulas or a list of structures that can be used
        to teach a language.</p>
    <p>6. The formulas in a language description are laid up in a specific order. It can be a valuable tool for shaping
        educational resources. There are cases where a strict order is not required.</p>
    <p>Activities for teaching and learning a language are provided by pedagogical grammar, which is itself a product of
        and support for the pedagogical process of learning a language. There is always easy access to unofficial
        information regarding the effectiveness of various approaches to language</p>

    <p>teaching. The classroom serves as the best learning laboratory most of the time. As a result of this focus on the
        student's educational needs, the scope of language learning research could be expanded. Some educators continue
        to defend the value of what is often known as action research, and this is where linguistics can shine. This
        study area has also contributed to the need for a more empirical foundation on which to judge the success of
        language instruction and acquisition.</p>
    <p>Activities in language education transform the results of linguistically theoretical scholarly discussion and
        research into postulates that govern appropriate language use. A bridge that serves the interests of both
        linguistics and education is required. This service is made possible by the relatively new discipline of applied
        linguistics.</p>
    <p>While structural linguists may believe that linguistics can aid language teaching, transformational linguists
        make no such claims, as pointed out by Ramelan. The second group maintains that linguistics is its scientific
        field and should study the language for what it is: a means of human communication rather than for how it may be
        used in schools. Chomsky (a transformative figure) famously informed a group of language teachers that a
        linguist never intends to worry about the difficulties of language instruction, which may be at odds with this
        view.</p>
    <p>One criticism of this school argues that transformationalists are wrong and instead argue that teachers should
        encourage their students to use their native creativity when teaching a foreign language. Structural linguists
        widely acknowledge the importance of linguistics in language education, and this view is inextricable from
        Bloomfield's perspective. He is an authority on the subject of language education and a linguist.</p>
    <p>His keen interest in language education evidences this. He spoke out against the grammar-translation approach. In
        his view, foreign language instruction should prioritize students' ability to communicate orally. Without a
        solid foundation in the methodology itself, any attempt to use a teaching technique to introduce new subject
        matter is doomed to fail. If not properly implemented, the strategy can work against the progress of the
        instructional process rather than helping to bring about the desired results. So, it is crucial to have a
        thorough and accurate grasp of a technique's attributes.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
        The study of language from a scientific perspective is known as linguistics. Linguistics is more than just an
        academic discipline that studies language for its own sake; it also has an educational purpose. There is a
        strong connection between linguistics and language education. This is due to the correlation between language
        instruction and linguistic development. How can a language instructor train students in writing without a firm
        grasp of the fundamentals of language study (spelling, morphology, syntax, semantics, and lexicology)? As a
        language instructor, he needs to be fluent in the target language and have a firm grasp of its rules to convey
        those laws to his students effectively. Language teachers, according to Robert Lado, need to be familiar with
        the linguistic features and facts of their students' native languages in order to diagnose their students'
        difficulties with the target language.</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        When learning analytical skills in students, it is advisable to use the concept of" formation-formation". This
        understanding is of urgent importance for our research work.</p>
    <p>Formation-formation is understood as the process of a person's occurrence, decision – making under the influence
        of all-environmental, economic, social, ideological, psychological factors, without any exception, as opposed to
        the social one.</p>
    <p>The educator, oriented towards the personality model of pedagogical interaction, should actively support the
        independent educational and educational processes of students, strive to activate the learner himself. The use
        of bioinformational technologies for personality-developing education implies not just the concentration of
        knowledge and skills, but the mechanism of self-organization and self-realization of the future specialist, the
        formation of a flexible and constant, the emergence of his analytical skills and abilities. When applying such
        technologies, the educational environment creates much more free conditions. These conditions provide the
        student with the opportunity to choose an individual development trajectory, not having the same problem of
        normative construction of his activities. The educator forms, builds the content of Education, relying on the
        identified interests and subjective experience of the educator. It must be perceived by the learner as a person
        of importance to himself, as "missed" content through his personal subjective experience.</p>
    <p>The direction of the pedagogical process to the individual, the search and development of abilities that nature
        places on each individual, the construction of a pedagogical system aimed at the individual are</p>

    <p>important requirements for today's Education, strictly dictating the need to change the traditional approaches to
        education. The assistance of modern pedagogical technologies to identify and formulate their competencies in
        connection with the competence and interests of future specialists as individuals gives preference to the
        intended educational methods.</p>
    <p>The style of projects is considered one such style. It allows you to ensure the systematic integration of
        scientific knowledge and practical actions, develop the interest of the learner in the process of obtaining
        independent knowledge and his reflexive positions in this process, build his own activities based on concrete
        practical requirements, form skills for establishing, acquire the experience of independent creative activity
        and conscious choice of ways of self-realization. Teaching on the basis of the style of projects increases
        motivation for studying, provides the basis for the formation of skills for cooperation and Inter-chassis
        communication, allows you to successfully adapt to the significantly changing conditions of human life in modern
        society. Students acquire the skills of transferring knowledge to another context, to a modified situation,
        trying not to simply memorize the facts, but to search for information, to carry it out analytically , tasks
        independently. As a result of training, it happens not only to master new knowledge, skills and abilities, but
        also to form analytical skills. These guarantee that the graduate's mobile and non-slip (flexible), future
        professional activities will be successful.</p>
    <p>Thus, the analysis of the requirements of state educational standards for the results of professional training of
        graduates, the specificity of the professional activities of software creators provides an opportunity to
        clarify the requirements for the analytical activities of a specialist in the field of bioinformational
        technologies. This activity is based on the formation of analytical skills. Based on the results of the
        conducted analysis, a model for the formation of analytical skills of students was developed. This model
        provides an opportunity to reveal the content of the components of this process: targeted,
        theoretical-methodological, consequential-tolerating components (figure 1.2).</p>
    <p>The target component involves the goals and objectives of the formation of analytical skills. And these goals and
        objectives are determined by the requirements of state educational standards for the results of professional
        education of graduates and the specificity of the future professional activity of graduates.</p>
    <p>The theoretical-methodological component embodies the foundations of the formation of analytical skills based on
        such principles as professional orientation, reflexivity, independence and activity, the provision of the choice
        of individual educational trajectory, cooperation within the framework of approaches to personality, competency,
        technology and activity.</p>
    <p>The content component describes the organization and implementation of the educational process aimed at the
        formation of analytical skills and promotes the restoration of the content of future professional activities in
        the process of mastering the block of professionally oriented disciplines. The methodological component of the
        model reflects the comprehensively effective forms, methods and means of organizing education, pedagogical
        conditions in order to form analytical skills in the process of training IT specialists.</p>

    <p>The result-assessment component involves diagnosing the methods and means of assessing to what extent analytical
        skills are formed, the degree of formation of these skills in accordance with the motational, cognitive,
        reflexive and creative criteria, their indicators and distinguished levels. In higher education, the model for
        the formation of analytical skills of specialists in the field of bioinformative technologies I provides for the
        implementation of functions that activate the subject, professionally reform, are oriented towards practice.</p>
    <p>The function of activating the subject determines the main role of the student as a subject of education in the
        educational process. In the process of interaction with educators, the student acquires methods of
        self-education, self-knowledge and self-realization. This function, when viewed from the position of each
        individual person, makes it necessary to provide pedagogical support for professional education, motivational
        and subjectively conditioned increase in its importance, to be prepared for it throughout life, the evolution of
        another position held by a person in all social processes, to change the status occupied by the learner in
        education. The position of the subject of knowledge is realized in the student if he: if he independently
        acquires new knowledge and uses existing knowledge creatively, using the experience of his personal life
        activity extensively; if he consciously chooses and actively uses methods of educational work that characterize
        not only the achieved result, but also the process of acquiring knowledge; makes independent and responsible
        decisions to choose the educational tools that apply to him, and thus actively influences what and how he
        learns; if he plans his educational work, analyzes, predicts and evaluates its results; if individual interests,
        taking into account needs, build cooperation relations with other people, respecting their national, spiritual,
        cultural traditions; when, in the process of working together, he coordinates his personal point of view with
        the opinions of others.</p>
    <p>The professional reform function creates conditions for updating the knowledge of the learner and overcoming
        stereotypes of his experience, puts mechanisms for updating concepts formed in practical professional activities
        (as a result of personal experience, such as trying and making mistakes, victory and failure). In this case, it
        will be necessary to professionally train the future creators of software, taking into account the concrete
        sectors and IT sectors of the economy, based on the demand and their qualifications that are happening to them
        in the labor market.</p>
    <p>The practice-oriented function reflects the presence of analytical skills in students in solving a problem
        situation, the need for a technological approach to tracing any professional situation in which a program of
        professional behavior is developed in relation to shui.</p>
    <p>At the higher educational institution, the methodological basis of the model for the formation of the student's
        analytical skills is the field of approaches to the shasx, competency, technological and activity.</p>
    <p>Within the framework of the approach towards the individual, the idea of the priority of the social, active and
        creative essence of the individual was decided, the development of the professional qualities of the shaskh was
        determined to be important, it was envisaged to take into account that the individuality of the future IT
        specialist is unique. Student-the main subject of the educational process. The student retains the right of
        educational work to the student to acquire knowledge, skills, establish his place in knowledge and realize
        himself by acquiring methods that provide adequate tools in their application in situations not foreseen in
        education.</p>
    <p>A competency approach makes it possible to accurately determine the goals of pedagogical activity at a higher
        educational institution in order to ensure that the specialist is able to apply his analytical skills</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>in a consistent, consequential way, as opposed to the structural components of professional competence. A
        specific task, which is considered important in the profession, requires the future programmer to show
        competence when solving the range of issues on the basis of knowledge, skills, qualifications, abilities,
        guidance, values acquired during professional education.</p>
    <p>The question of readiness for action is considered by researchers from two different perspectives: functional and
        personality-specific. The first position figures define readiness, shaylik as a separate functional state, a
        psychological condition for the success of the activity performed against the background of the general activity
        of the organism, as opposed to the socially recorded instruction. Proponents of the personality approach view
        readiness as a complex intagral personality education. Its components are considered the formation of psychic
        processes, States and properties of the individual.</p>
    <p>Readiness to conduct activities provides for the presence in learners of the following structural elements: a
        positive attitude to various manifestations of activity, occupation; aspects of character, abilities,
        temperament corresponding to the requirements of activity, occupation; necessary knowledge, skills,
        qualifications; stable professionally significant characteristics of perception, attention, thinking, emotional
        and volitional processes.</p>
    <p>As opposed to the integrated quality of the professional's readiness, shaylik is considered the main condition
        for the specialist's rapid adaptation to professional activities, adaptation, further professional growth and
        continuous, inexhaustible increase in his qualifications.</p>
    <p>The technological approach implies the organization of such an educational process, in which the acquisition of
        ways and methods of organizing the process of formation of analytical activity skills, analytical skills is
        ensured through the implementation of a problematic, developing issue-tasks. Programming is related to the task
        solving process, an issue that the student implements. To solve the problem-tasks, he mentally looks for
        different ways, chooses suitable instruments or prepares them himself mutsaqil. Programming is a kind of
        knowledge of the world, in which the first plan comes out one or another issue-the search, formation of ideas
        and concepts that will be necessary for solving tasks. Learning begins with practical action and perception,
        moves from them to words and concepts, and ends with the development of some characteristic of the mental
        structure.</p>
    <p>Educational tools used to form students analytical skills include the following components: training and
        production equipment as opposed to computers, in which learners develop professional skills and qualifications;
        educational and methodological support designed to support the course transition; electronic and educational
        resources and Internet resources.</p>
    <p>As a result of the application of interactive technologies, the following issues of the educational process will
        find a solution: to increase the efficiency and optimality of mastering the educational material; to arouse the
        interest of the individual in the study of the subjects provided for in the curriculum, to strengthen
        motivation; to bring the educational information provided closer to the; teaching to respect the right of the
        participant who is working together to express personal opinion; the formation of life and professional skills.
    </p>
    <p>Both practical classes and lectures are conducted in an interactive form. A problematic lecture, a lecture with
        deliberately allowed errors, a lecture-visualization is separated. In the process of professional training of
        specialists in the field of bioinformational technologies I, a number of specific and expected goals were aimed
        at achieving from the application of interactive technologies: strengthening motivation for obtaining active
        knowledge; formation of analytical skills and reflexive</p>

    <p>Thus, the corresponding model takes the field in the process of professional education as an approximate basis
        for the realization of the process of formation of analytical skills in future specialists of the field I of

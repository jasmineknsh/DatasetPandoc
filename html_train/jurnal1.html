    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        The continuous pursuit of improving the quality and nutritional profile of bakery products has led to the
        exploration of various bioactive additives (BAAs) derived from natural sources. Grains, as a fundamental
        component of human diets, offer a rich reservoir of bioactive compounds that can be harnessed to enhance the
        functional properties of bakery products. The development of methods to obtain such BAAs from grains is
        essential to advancing food science, particularly in the creation of value-added bakery goods that meet modern
        consumer demands for health and wellness.</p>
    <p>Grains are not only a primary source of carbohydrates but also contain a wide range of bioactive compounds,
        including dietary fibers, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. These components contribute to
        various health benefits, such as improved digestion, enhanced immune</p>

    <p>function, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. However, traditional bakery products often undergo processing
        techniques that can diminish the bioavailability and functionality of these nutrients. The development of
        innovative methods to extract and concentrate these bioactive compounds from grains can lead to the production
        of BAAs that significantly improve the quality of bakery products. By integrating these BAAs into bakery
        formulations, it is possible to enhance the nutritional value, sensory properties, and shelf life of the final
        products. Moreover, these methods must be optimized to ensure that the bioactive compounds retain their efficacy
        during the baking process, which often involves exposure to high temperatures.</p>
    <p>This research focuses on the development of such methods, with a particular emphasis on leveraging regionally
        available grains. The goal is to create BAAs that not only improve the health benefits of bakery products but
        also align with sustainability practices by utilizing locally sourced ingredients. Through this approach, the
        study aims to contribute to the broader field of functional food development, offering insights into how
        grain-derived BAAs can be effectively used to produce bakery products that cater to both nutritional needs and
        consumer preferences.This production provides the basis for the use of grains that are harvested as a source of
        biologically valuable components in the preparation of Functional Foods, which is one of the modern trends in
        food technology. In this study, a mixture of sprouted grains containing grains of wheat, oats, barley and corn
        that were floured in equal amounts was used as an unconventional raw material[3].</p>
    <p>This mixture of germinated grains contains vitamins (A, YE, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, n, choline, RR), trace
        elements (boron, molybdenum, selenium, chromium, iron, vanadium, manganese, zinc, iodine, copper, fluorine),
        minerals (potassium, calcium, silicon, magnesium, phosphorus), essential amino acids (valine, isoleucine,
        leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine) and enzymes (lipase, proteases, phosphatases,
        α - and β-amylases), have been found to be rich[4]. According to the results of test baking in our preliminary
        studies, it was recommended to add a mixture of grains, which were ground to a higher grade of flour weight in
        an amount of 15% to improve the nutritional and biological value of bread. It has been found that adding a
        mixture of flour-infused grains to wheat flour reduces bread size and its porosity. The use of BAA in the
        production of bakery products makes it possible to eliminate the negative impact of unconventional raw materials
        on the quality of dough and bread, as well as activate the technological process, prolong the novelty life of
        Bakery Products.</p>
    <p>To increase the quality of prolonging the freshness of products made with the addition of a mixture of whole
        grains, it is recommended to use multicomponent bread enhancers containing minerals (wheat flour, soy flour,
        starch), oxidants, reducing agents, enzymes, emulsifiers, ground wheat flour, ground wheat extract, improved
        starches, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate, calcium phosphate, ammonium chloride,
        carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose), lecithin, soy flour, dry milk, vegetable protein) and hydrogenated vegetable
        oils.The purpose of the study is to develop a multicomponent cooking improvement tool that increases the quality
        of the product and prolongs their novelty life, by using a mixture of wheat, oats, corn and barley grain in
        wheat flour. To improve multicomponent cooking, bfq-quality components belonging to food additives, generally
        recognized as safe, were used.</p>

    <p><strong>ATERIALS AND METHODS</strong><br />
        The development of the improving composition of multicomponent baking was carried out using the effect of
        individual food additives on the quality of bread. The flour from the ground wheat was assessed for its effect
        on the porosity of the bread, the change in fracture deformation, the formation of the upper layer and the
        accumulation of chissium and dextrins in the bread.</p>
    <p>The study used a sprouted mixture of wheat, oats, barley and corn grains produced in the Department</p>
    <p>of” food safety and functional products technology".</p>
    <p>The dough is made from high-grade wheat flour, the dough samples are prepared according to the recipe, in gram:
        high-grade wheat flour, 100gr; pressed yeast, 3GR; salt, 1.5 gr; ground flour mixture of wheat, oats, barley and
        corn grains, 15gr. The dough is kneaded in a two-speed mixer mixing machine (Russia), dressing a uniform mixture
        with a moisture content of 44.0%. The fermentation period was carried out in a 20-minute tin. Dough processing
        was carried out manually, the inspection was carried out at a temperature of 40 ± 2 °C and at a relative
        humidity of 82 ± 2% until it was ready. The bread was baked in an artel oven (Uzbekistan) in a baking chamber
        moistened at a temperature of 210-220 °C for 28 minutes. All experiments were carried out in at least three
        copies.</p>
    <p><strong>Results and their discussion</strong><br />
        BAA is enriched in whey powder, wheat protein powder, tapinambur inulin, carboxymethylcellulose, lactic acid. In
        bread-making technology, wheat flour, which was floured into the flour mixture, was introduced in 15%
        quantities, and this mixture was found to be acceptable in 1.8% quantities as an additive that improved
        multicomponent baking displays.</p>
    <p>The addition of BAA provides the organoleptic properties and specific volume of bread enriched with a mixture of
        flour, which is no different from control. The introduction of a multicomponent baking enhancer increases the
        overall, plastic and elastic deformations of breadcrumbs, reducing fracture markers and layer thickness under
        the crust. The deformation of breadcrumbs enriched with a mixture of ground grain and a developed multicomponent
        baking enhancer was twice that of control (wheat bread) after 72 hours of storage. The addition of a
        multicomponent baking enhancer to bread containing a 15% uncooked grain mixture to flour weight increased the
        accumulation of low molecular weight dextrins by 77.6% compared to control.</p>

    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />
        The research focused on the development and application of a multicomponent baking enhancer (BAA) demonstrated
        significant improvements in the quality and shelf life of wheat bread enriched with a mixture of germinated
        grains. The incorporation of this enhancer into bread-making processes yielded multiple benefits, addressing
        critical factors such as texture, volume, moisture retention, and the overall sensory attributes of the final
        product.</p>
    <p>One of the primary findings of this study was the positive impact of the multicomponent baking enhancer on the
        structural properties of bread. The introduction of a 15% germinated grain mixture into the wheat flour,
        complemented by the BAA, resulted in a marked increase in the plastic and elastic deformation of breadcrumbs.
        This improvement is crucial, as it directly correlates with the bread’s ability to maintain its softness and
        resilience over time, reducing the brittleness often associated with extended storage. Notably, the deformation
        of breadcrumbs enriched with the BAA was twice that of the control wheat bread after 72 hours of storage,
        highlighting the enhancer's effectiveness in preserving bread quality.</p>
    <p>The addition of the BAA also had a significant influence on the organoleptic properties of the bread. Despite the
        inclusion of a complex mixture of ingredients, the bread's specific volume and sensory characteristics remained
        consistent with that of the control, indicating that the enhancer did not adversely affect the bread's
        traditional qualities. This finding is particularly important for consumer</p>
    <p>acceptance, as it ensures that the nutritional enhancements do not come at the expense of the bread’s familiar
        taste and texture.</p>
    <p>The application of such enhancers in the bakery industry has the potential to meet consumer demands for
        higher-quality, more nutritious, and longer-lasting bread products, ultimately leading to broader adoption in
        commercial baking practices<strong>.</strong>The use of a developed multicomponent baking improvement tool has a
        positive effect on the quality of wheat bread enriched with a mixture of germinated grains and prolongs the
        freshness of bread to 72 hours without packaging.</p>

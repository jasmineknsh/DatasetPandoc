    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
        Linguistic concept is the main unit of culture that has an ethnocultural character and conveys functionally
        important information about existence. It represents spiritual universals. Linguistic concept exists in
        thinking, it combines cognitive-rational and emotional-psychological content. The linguistic and cultural
        concept serves as a worldview model for all language speakers. The linguistic and cultural concept is a cultural
        tool influencing the formation of national character. Concepts of culture are studied separately in Linguistics.
        The main concepts of culture are important in the consciousness of the collective language, in particular,
        conscience, fate, fate, will, sin, law, freedom, intellectuals, homeland, etc. are understood. It can be seen
        that linguistic, cultural, sociological (content analysis, frame analysis method), ethnographic (description,
        classification, etc.) methods are used in linguistic and cultural research. In most linguistic and cultural
        studies, it is noted that these methods complement each other with different principles and analyzes and allow
        research of the interaction between language and culture, which is a complex object of language and culture. It
        is possible to observe the use of a specific object, for example, an animal, as a standard of stable analogy in
        various linguistic cultures. For example, in most languages, the fox is used as a symbol of trickery, deceit,
        and deception: хитрый как лиса (Russian), as false as fox (English), you chorom (Korean). Or, as the unique
        similes of the Uzbek language, it is possible to show - as gentle as a sheep, thin as a ghost, eats like a mole,
        etc.</p>

    <p>Being able to use lexical, grammatical, and stylistic methods in accordance with translation norms improves the
        quality of translation. Even in the words expressing the color, the cultural traditions of different peoples are
        visible, if we take the color red, in the USA "danger" in France "aristocracy" in India "life and creativity" in
        Japan and "anger" in China is a symbol of happiness. From this it can be said that the concept of color reflects
        emotional and emotional factors along with social culture. It is the author's intention to use expressions
        related to color in fiction. On the contrary, it is a tool that reflects the subtleties of the language used to
        increase the effectiveness of the author's creative thoughts. When translating literary texts, the translator's
        task is to fully convey the author's intention in the language being translated. In fiction, colors are widely
        used to name characters and to describe their behavior.</p>
    <p>The transformational model of translation is based on N. Chomsky's rules of transformational grammar.
        Transformational grammar studies the basic logic-syntactic relationship and the rules of derivation of syntactic
        structures characterized by the similarity of lexemes. According to transformational grammar, all types of
        syntactic structures can be combined into nuclear structures in which the transparency of logical-syntactic
        structures is limited.</p>
    <p>Surface structures are formed from nuclear structures according to known transformation rules. If we consider
        English sentences as a nuclear structure through the sentences mentioned by John Dryden in the prologue of the
        tragedy "Aurangzeb", a number of transformations can be made from this sentence: The court greatly encouraged
        the play of 'Aureng-Zebe.'<br />
        The play of 'Aureng-Zebe' greatly encouraged by the court<br />
        It was the play of 'Aureng-Zebe' who was greatly encouraged by the court<br />
        The greatly encouraging of play of "Aureng-Zebe." by the court</p>
    <p>Korolevsky dvor court greatly supported and encouraged the "Aureng-Zebe" game.</p>
    <p>The Aureng-Zebe match was widely encouraged by the court This game of "Aureng-Zebe" was widely encouraged by the
        court.</p>
    <p>Aureng-Zebe's game is widely encouraged by the court<br />
        When translating from one language to another, not only its direct translation, but also the essence of the
        content is given deep importance. In most of the linguistic cultures, we can see stable similes in terms of
        image and its content, as well as the similarity of comparative objects. For the Uzbek linguistic culture, it is
        normal to compare a woman's face to a moon, an apple, sometimes a kulcha, in the English to a cherry, a rose (as
        red as a cherry/rose), in Chinese and Koreans to an apricot, a willow branch. In China and Korea, women are
        happy when they are compared to snakes. Because in these linguistic cultures, the snake is a symbol of wisdom,
        beauty and dexterity. The same concept can be expressed in different linguistic cultures by means of different
        means of expression, that is, by means of different analogical standards. For example, the Uzbeks compare strong
        people to an elephant, and the English compare them to a horse: strong as a horse. Or, Uzbeks likens people who
        work tirelessly to an ant, and Turks like a bee.</p>
    <p>Let's consider another example. If we take the sentence "The princess Melesinda, bathed in tears" from John
        Dryden's tragedy "Aurangzeb" as a nuclear structure, the following artificial structures can be created based on
        the rules of transformational grammar: "Princess Melesinda bathed in tears, (bathing (ing) )", "Princess
        Melesinda is washing with tears" in these structures the main relationship is preserved "the owner of the action
        is the action". V. N. Komissarov said that despite the diversity</p>

    <p>of the forms that make up the structure, these transformations have a significant level of content and meaning in
        common.</p>
    <p>If we take another example from Aurangzeb's drama, "An ill dream, or a cloudy day, has power to change this
        wretched creature", "cloudy day" in Uzbek means "cloudy day", i.e. a fall in mood , explains that a person is in
        a sad, depressed mood.</p>
    <p>Linguistics is related to ethnolinguistics, a field that approaches each other in some issues with the sciences
        of ethnography and physical science, which study the life and cultural characteristics of peoples, their origin,
        location, cultural-historical interactions. The main direction of ethnolinguistic research studies the activity
        and development of linguistic, entocultural and ethno-spiritual (ethnopsychological) factors in language.</p>

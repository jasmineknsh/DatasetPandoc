                <strong>1.The Relationship between Family Smoking Status and the Incidence of</strong>
                <strong>Tuberculosis in
                        the Working Area of the Banjarejo Community Health Center,</strong> <strong>Madiun
                        City</strong><br />
                Based on the results of the univariate analysis that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the
                frequency distribution between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of
                the
                Banjarejo Community Health Center, Madiun City is dominated by respondents with smoking status, totaling
                35
                respondents, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 67.3%. Meanwhile, there were 17 respondents
                with
                non-smoking status, both cases and controls, with a percentage of 32.7%.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, based on the results of bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test which was used to determine
                the
                relationship between smoking status variables and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of
                the
                Banjarejo Health Center, Madiun City, the results showed that in the case group of respondents with a
                family
                history of smoking status there were 22 respondents with a percentage of 84. 6%, and those with no
                family
                history of smoking status were 4 respondents with a percentage of 15.4%. Meanwhile, in the control group
                with
                family smoking status there were 13 respondents with a percentage of 50% and there were 13 respondents
                with
                non-smoking status with a percentage of 50%.</p>
        <p>So, based on the calculation results, the p-value = 0.018 (p &lt; 0.05) is obtained, which means that there
                is a
                relationship between smoking status and the incidence of tuberculosis in the working area of the
                Banjarejo

        <p>According to Giacomo's theory, smoking is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and is often
                the
                main cause of death worldwide related to cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory tract infections,
                COPD,
                pulmonary TB and respiratory tract cancer. The respiratory epithelium is the main barrier against
                harmful
                environmental agents and protects by sweeping particles out in the mucus layer, phagocytizing and
                recruiting
                other immune cells. Smoking can directly</p>
